Squad,OwO,Hey you too buddy,idc what you call me,arakune's my tag,so no reason y not,a RaccAttack,we've won every single 3v3 tournament we've ever entered,I overslept today and my teammates got smashed,rip,... Does everyone know that?,WUTFACE,but 2v2 has nothing to do with skill, only comp,🤔,u simply follow these FOUR EASY STEPS to win every 2v2 tournament,doctors HATE HIM,1. select taya,2. select lucie,3. rururururururur,4. obtain money,Condemned.,Don't harass averse about it,he and I already talked,he had a bad day and I wasn't there to carry, it happens.,He's carried me when I play bad plenty,i blame me more than him,apparently, in the words of averse,condemned couldnt keep up with NA ping, him and ninjas had 0 synergy,and on top of that averse himself played bad,it happens,FeelsRifletownMan,in the NA 3v3 scene, 2nd place is basically the same as last,very little skill difference,hence averse getting last,ULU,:nobully:,NA brain lag LUL,for a game with 1200 players at a time, it's not bad,that's like 5% competitive playerbase,aka better than you'd typically expect,it's just the games themselves are normally much bigger,A M E R I C A,M,E,R,I,C,A,,im soooooo angry,i've ruined averse's image of this unbeatable player AND i've now caused the common perception that EU > NA because EU is beating a so-so NA team in the NA finals,just cause i overslept for one tournament,now i have to win both tournaments next week to set things straight,such a pain,hotbiscuit's team is going to,I mean, if they lose, I don't even. I guess ping is a valid reason.,wuzac blankz,ya,so now averse loses round 1 in both na and eu and EU wins both tournaments,everyone's gonna think EU's better,where's the goddamn reaper,see what i mean?,He still is.,averse is the best player on the planet by such a huge margin it's almost unfair,it's like the guy is cheating or something,but it's a team based game,do you want an actual answer to that?,i probably shouldn't give you one,same,I mean, im watching the matches on ur vods,and I can tell you why you lost pretty easily,This is so sad, i didn't think it would be this bad.,You guys are literally 2v3ing the 2nd best team in NA,and winning,r a c i a l t r a i t s,"competitive discord",<:joltzieT:262452962897559552>,fuck sheep \ <:joltzieW:268031910498795520> /,white windmill of

mean,lol,have they never interacted with actually malicious dickheads before?,because i have,and they make me look like a saint,i wanted to get in EU scrims,gotta get used to the ping,2's is worthless,?,i simply mean we won't ever lose,it's pointless,doesn't even count as practice,3's is better cause sometimes your teammates are actually uncarryable,which means you get to practice playing perfect in unwinnable scenarios,prolly my favorite thing in the game,feels really satisfying to know when you lose a round that you did nothing wrong,u guys underestimate,ping doesn't rly matter,ping only matters against good players,and there's like 10 or so in EU,?,you've got it backwards,rook player PogChamp //,ya, i knew that would happen,i oversleep for one tournament and fucking fireblaze is left to defend america's pride,seems like i have to do everything myself,now eu players are gonna get this idea that they're better than NA,<@250636384774127616> i've been the 2nd best player behind averse for a long, long time,that's globally btw, not just NA,yes,it's clear u dont follow the competitive scene,but i've never even dropped a game in a 3v3 tournament,literally not 1 game,lol,the only time we lost in 2v2 was to averse/stro cus they had the hardest counter to our comp in the game,but now with ninjas playing lucie we'd probably beat them,idk, i don't really lose very often,to be fair, on that patch, it was correct,now with the jumong nerf lucie/taya and lucie/shifu beat it,it's still a p good comp tho,top tier,hey hansa, how much money have u won in tournaments,you seem to be a couple months behind the meta of the game,2-3 months ago, me being a good player actually was a meme, because I was on the comeup but I was already talking about how I was better than everyone else,fast forward to present day,im actually better than everyone else,just as i said i would be,no surprises,merciful averse <:FeelsAmazingMan:269921212396863498>,ironically, the only reason EU looked so strong in the tournament yesterday is because I wasn't there.,Averse/ninjas had to replace me with condemned,who frankly isn't even near me, especially on NA ping,ya oldur jumong is only ok now,it's probably top 10 comp,but nothing unbeatable like lucie/taya,i mean im glad my teammates at least crushed the 2v2 tournament when i was gone,didn't COMPLETELY let america down,but everyone cares about 3v3 more,yo averse,in our comp do you prefer jumong or taya?,word,yeah, we will,idk what averse's deal is with klerny/condemned,but you can't place any worse than last,20?,it's less than that,lol,in NA there's 4,and in EU there's like, maybe 10,i mean i dont think im that much better than averse,but if you say so,im just inferring the only thing that makes sense,how can you weigh the guy who lost round 1 in both tournaments above me when i've never lost a single game in 3v3?,especially when the only difference between the two comps was replacing me with condemned,i don't lose,i mean i love averse, individually he's a more skilled player,ya ur pretty good,better than any NA lucie,it doesn't matter how good he is,he's worse than me,by a lot,im literally,freedom fighter,oh come on,u guys dont like a little friendly rivalry,i can't just let EU think they're better without facing the real deal,look,when we lose to an EU team on NA ping, I'll admit EU is better,i really will,best mechanical player playing highest skillcap champ in a 1v1?,now that sounds interesting,daniel best shifu,haHAA,well, you're a worthy opponent,ok,i've never lost a 1v1 to anyone except averse tho,since the game came out,in any matchup,i just look at maylon's picture,and think the same thing,honestly,u guys are too hype,i already told u,i dont lose,,if he wants to, sure,u can pick server 213,i think my lowest ping us EUEast,cus routing,i look forward to the tournament on saturday ^-^,^-^,i've wanted to scrim EU teams for a while,rook vs shifu is pretty impossible for shifu,when i 1v1 rook, i play jumong,:3,o?,hansa, i've never seen u play,u sure?,sure,i'll say this tho,i dont think my jumong is good enough to beat rook on 151 ping,but on NA i'll definitely win,well, i really wasn't joking. im the 2nd best player in NA behind averse,there's a difference between beating averse and beating me and averse on the same team,that shit's hard,predict <:PogChamp:269924172002492417> //,ya i hit literally every one of nikita's counters,and on my screen i was literally 180 degrees not even facing him,and it just gets hit anyway,pretty troll,averse doesn't like shounen,i've already argued with him,a ton about it,he's the worst,i'll play condemned if he wants,im not really warmed up,but it doesn't matter,condemned made the best team in NA lose to a team we've beaten 10-0 in finals 4 or 5 times,he made my whole region look bad,i have to avenge america,give me condemned,blc <:PogChamp:269924172002492417>,<@157962194988826632> sorry, i dont speak

attacked water bottle,rip floor,brb,dude i broke my keyboard by spilling an entire bottle of water in it,woke up 12  hours later,it was a different color,not broken anymore,?????,shifu 1v1s are decided within the first 20 seconds normally,the neutral is the entire thing,all things are relative,with my skill my ego is pretty normal,you ever heard that saying,"it's not cocky if you're good",u guys should play town of salem some time,i've wanted pro battlerite player tos,for SO long,it's legit my favorite thing,ever,lame,dude im legit beast at that game,that game is "be a sociopath" the

what a good game is,like they don't play real hardcore competitive games,so i could see people thinking paladins is good,who like BR,but paladins hella bad,paladins is like a shittier version of

is rocking my ass in 1v1 rn,eh,it's doable,lost 5-4,na,to be fair tho rook's entire game is doing his autofreeeasy 120 damage combo to u and the orb,and like, he hasn't missed it once,so i don't think it changes much,,I've thought a lot.,Like, a lot a lot,i've watched a lot fo vids and done some soulsearching,I really think that my mentality is the key to success,and rather than complaining about the devs or about game balance or about teammates,my only goal should be to become the perfect player,and then, if u lose, everything is whatever.,nothing u could do,like look,i really do think that shifu has some bad matchups, such as taya and iva,but even if they really are hard matchups,do i have the right to complain about them if I don't play perfect?,imo i don't,nobody has hit ceiling yet,the point is,the person to reach it first will win everything,regardless of balance,regardless of everything else,the person who makes 0 mistakes won't lose,because at least for now, everyone else is making mistakes,if i don't make mistakes and you do, I win.,almost always,rather than being angry at the game, you should be angry at yourself,being extremely self critical is the way to improve,it's just very mentally hard,cause no matter what you do you think it's bad,improving is fun,trying to win is fun,discovering faults in your play and learning is fun,yes,the concept of becoming better at something, learning, analyzing, improving,is fun,in any game,in anything,it's a great feeling to practice hard and to win and see results,and it's a shitty feeling to lose, like a really shitty feeling,but actually out of losing, you learn,and that's a good feeling too,the hard painful part is admitting it's your fault and that you're the reason you lost and that there are things you do wrong,Not things you do kind of right or things you could do better,things that are just wrong. Just bad.,No positive side,it's hard to accept that you have flaws,well, this is just my opinion of course,but i really enjoy gaming most when im trying as hard as i can to improve,there's something really satisfying about it,But is winning good enough if you win because the competition is bad?,For me, it isn't.,I want to be so good that my skill is undisputed. I want to be so skilled that nobody can ever beat me.,I want to be perfect,ah, but you can,through extremely extremely hard work,Nobody can be perfect all the time.,But you can have moments of perfect play,striving for an impossible goal is half the fun,as long as you keep recognizing your mistakes and improving, you'll continue to get better. Forever.,The goal isn't to be the best player, the goal is to get better,until nobody can ever beat you again,They lack talent. They lack motivation. They lack the tools to know how to constructively improve.,Like I said, there's a right mentality to maximize your potential,and it's a mentality almost nobody can accept,it's borderline masochistic,it's me having a 90% winrate over 50 games, almost every win being a 3-0 blowout that lasts less than 5 minutes,and still saying i played bad,still recognizing mistakes and improving even then,you can never be content,never,It gets to the point where eventually you've improved everything you can think of to the highest level you reasonably can, and you still lose. And at that point it's easy to blame the game or to get angry, but even then you need to find new smaller things you can improve, think outside the box, practice more.,Well, I read what you said,but perfect play is something nobody will ever achieve.,even in this "easier" "low skill ceiling" game,I said perfect play was the goal,not that you could actually do it.,You misunderstand,With a combination of extreme talent, extreme amount of hours put into the game, and extremely improvement focused mindset,nobody can face you,people are only human,the fastest anyone could improve is at the same rate as me,and that's only IF they practiced as hard and with the same mentality,which almost nobody can,It isn't really ego, it's reality.,People have talent.,Anything.,If you've mastered 1v1 against a certain character, master it against every other character, master it on every different map, understand every single possible sequence of events possible and turn them into muscle memory. at that point move onto 2v2 and 3v3,coach your teammates until they're as good as you can make them,hope for the best,i'm only one guy, i can't be a team by myself,but if im an unbeatable individual player, half the work's already done,and im fortunate,my teammates are already unbeatable,im the weak link of my team,With averse and ninjas it doesn't worry me,they'll be fine,nah,averse and ninjas can beat anyone,im sure of it,it doesn't matter if you're NA or EU or how good you are,me and ninjas would beat you and condemned 2v2,hell, I'd beat you 1v2.,Yeah, comp matters.,We beat them too,with lucie/shifu,badly,and ninjas has less than 100 lucie games,it's obvious, isn't it?,averse is complacent with his skill, hasn't been practicing,he played like total shit,deserved the loss.,If it was me instead of condemned, we would've won,that's what it means to have reliable teammates,ninjas played so-so at best and averse played bad,but i would've destroyed everyone,there's been plenty of times that I'm playing awful and ninjas and averse play amazing and we 10-0 finals,ya,that kid is a prodigy tho,im super nice to ninjas,like, nicer than i am to anyone else on earth,lol,He knew he played like shit in that tournament, watched the vod, and thanked me for the critique,like i said, if u want to be the best u put ur pride aside,and you accept sometimes you do bad, stupid, terrible shit,and play awful,and you improve from it,of course,I met ninjas when he was g11,and i was g12,i knew he was a monster as soon as i met him,in g11 he was better than at least half of the g14 players,i mean, i was too,g14 was a joke,that's why we crushed everyone,lol,we went from unknown players nobody had ever heard of to 2nd place in every tournament, unbeatable by anyone except averse/stro in 3 weeks,and then we stayed there for like 3 months,u can spot talent and potential in players,instantly,is it growing a neckbeard?,it's not that special of a talent,who's filled with bullshit,the best shifu on earth,or the discord stream monster nobody's ever heard of,?,no im really asking you,who are u to tell me im full of shit,where are ur accomplishments,why should i show u any respect at all,like, insulting the way my eyes look doesn't make you seem more intelligent,it makes you seem desperate,you have no counterargument,im better than you, so the reality is nothing you say means anything,and nobody cares what you have to say,so stop speaking,You should learn your place,nah, maylon,really maylon,i wanna hear your argument on why you think im full of shit,and not some shit about how i don't go outside or dont have a life,an actual argument,for why you think im full of shit,<@150354957613268992>,just hold off nikita,i wanna see what he has to say,Because if I state something and you go "that's bullshit" explain why it's bullshit.,You're just hating to hate with no backing,<@150354957613268992> I've won every single 3v3 tournament i've ever entered without dropping a game.,"You haven't accomplished a single impressive thing",And?,I'm NA,I'm impressive,ergo,NA is impressive,as long as im breathing,NA is strong,Sure, beating scrubs doesn't mean you're good,but what about all the EU players i've beaten 1v1?,So I have a question for you,what'll happen when our team destroys EU teams on EU ping in 3v3 and 2v2?,then what?,Sounds unfair to me.,You're asking me to place first in the "stronger region" with an obvious tangible disadvantage?,not just me either, my entire team,You do understand if we do that, it's not "well, I guess NA isn't so bad after all",if we win the EU tourney on EU ping,NA > EU,we're just better,straight up.,and there's 0 argument against it,No, because you haven't faced me yet ^-^,<@105359026811846656> and both my team and averse's team 10-0'd you in semis.,Who cares?,You can't even put a dent in any good player in NA on NA ping,It's not hard to win a round with lag.,a single round,exblack mad cause i permabanned him on my stream as soon as i saw his name,stop cry,you were crying at me yesterday too,you just have a hardon for me because of EU pride and me banning you,it's a convenient excuse for you to cry,sorry, i have a real vendetta against bad players who think they're good,it's a personal pet peeve,wanna 1v1?,I'll put you in your place,didn't think so,Averse and Ninjas.,condemned replaced me the other day, cause I overslept.,gave my team their first ever loss,EU man,i mean,my whole thing is like,why condemned,they could've at least asked someone good,i was thinking like,joltz,but ya,🤔,idk who u even are,ya but like,i still dont know who u are,exactly what i said,never heard of you,i assumed ur ingame name was something different,Yeah but that's on you,im like the 2nd most well known NA player behind averse,have been for a while,wrestling <:PogChamp:269924172002492417>,being a legend in blc is like,i can't even think of a good comparison,something something special olympics,congrats, you were top 20 in a game with 50 players,<:PogChamp:269924172002492417> //,but i beat you a ton of times,🤔,america destroyed germany in 1940 today,dropped bombs,o?,u wanna do a rematch?,we can put money on it,any amount,yo nyy,i asked you a question,you trying to lose money or not,im tryna get paid,you guys are too nice,i don't mind,i really don't,i love when people question me so i can put them in their place,it doesn't bother me at all,but why wouldn't he,do you think a lion holds back when he kills a bunny?,of course not,🤔,i'd be ok with that,if they knew their place,1v1 condom,😦,LUL,actually like,chess is already chess,if u think about it,suckin on my nuts,FUCK EM,teldo contibuting,pog,game is fucked,when u wanna release ur game in 6 months and you take a month long vacation right after a major balance patch even tho you made 20x what you were predicting you'd make and have infinite money from EA sales,u know,someone's actually retarded at SLS,or all of them,yeah, cus they know the game will die once it goes f2p,they're selling out,cash cow,im just annoyed yet another game i've invested time and effort in becomes a failure,it's like,u think i become this good for fun,where's my fuckin money,dude the game at low hours,has less than 1000 players,73 people in GC = GC is top 10%,10%,are u shitting me,i was the 2nd person to get there on NA,and nobody else got there for like,3 weeks,i disagree,the fact u can't drop is insane,the fact u can get high rating bonus/rating too low didn't lose points,in GC is insane,ya but he's also averse,he'd break literally any system they could put in place and sit at #1 global,he's just way better than everyone in NA,why are u telling me shit i already know,when ONLY me and averse were in GC,I was complaining that it was too easy,then they made it easier like 3-4 times,players on reddit going "it worked! i used to be gold but now im champion!,actually insane,literally diamond is like,top 50%,dont even feel like im exaggerating,i've seen SO many champion players that are like,gold,like i can legit have my teammate die instantly and get like 40 score,and i 2v1 them and win,and it isn't even that close,these are "champion" players,2nd best shifu world,<:PogChamp:269924172002492417>,croak players dude,"I take root on E vs nearly every Hero with a counter, think Rook (can't chase), Sirius (stands still for the counter + root duration), varesh after I intentionally procced his counter so he can't move a bit, to stop rk from chasing you after cursing you... Good vs anything hard to catch like Lucie, Taya, Jumong... Endless possibilities.
Hard matchups are: Jade, reasons already listed in comments, and for me Poloma, because her Q is instant and works on already casted autos (such a dumb op mechanic...), her whole kit revolves around building range to your opponent. Good Lucies are hard also, but I rather dodge the panic bold than the cleanse potion."," because her Q is instant and works on already casted autos (such a dumb op mechanic...)",except,it,DOESN'T,?????????,why are u asking me,idk,im just a fucking retard who runs into people and holds m1,me shifu,ruhhhhhhh,basically by outplaying your opponent on mount, you can close the gap without wasting a gapcloser, forcing them to use escapes for absolutely nothing,on top of that, if you can get a particularly immobile champ to dismount like a sirius, oldur, pearl or lucie, you can like sirius petrify them for free as soon as they do an auto, if they use their only escape to dodge it, you kill them, if they don't, you kill their teammate,there's lots of practical uses to it,but it's nothing super unusual beyond how you normally take advantage of opponents that are at a CD disadvantage,like, there's nothing specifically unique about the mount game,it's just a free way to burn a cd,ya, shifu,ya,on champs who need energy early like jumong u just sit back forever,let ur teammate facetank,RK fucking SUCKS dick,most overrated champ in game,by far,dunno how anyone thinks he's good,sooooooooooooooooooooo bad,SO bad,nikita 🇷🇺,i main shifu,enough said,like RK might not be unplayably bad,but compare him to shifu,the god,shit's not even close,shifu is OP, but he isn't unbeatable like taya is, he still has a couple particularly hard matchups,but against ruh kaan you beat him 100% of the time,same with varesh and a couple others,he stands no chance,ya, agree,playing taya is playing pve,vs Very Hard AI,as long as u play well, u won't lose,well, it's possible (though unlikely) that shifu only gets a slap on the wrist nerf,if that happens, he'll be unbeatable,cause taya's gonna get anally devastated,2 months being that OP is way too long,they're gonna delete her from the game,good riddance,jade m1'd,are u both blind and stupid,or just stupid,no,he got incapped, instantly was hit out of it by jade m1, and he had input buffered m2,after the fact,you cant tell cus the framerate is shit,but i've seen the scenario plenty,it's ability queueing,happens all the time on shifu vs rook,i explained the scenario, the jade player was shitty and the rook was lucky and/or a god (lucky),"this game sucks because i dont understand game mechanics",the real thing u dont realize is ur a whiney bitch,however, once you DO understand game mechanics,you realize the game still sucks,but for different reasons,cast time on every ability hurr,cancelling abilities into defensive skills but not into other offensive skills hurr,ability queueing hurr,hurr,hurr,hurr,sls take vacation hurr,dont get me started on the 69 different game breaking bugs,moves going through counters that shouldn't, moves going on cd but not coming out for no reason, taya boomerangs going through walls and doing extra damage for some reason,shifu/sirius/jade ult cancel trick,like wtf,lol,...,NOT game breaking?,when u play perfectly and the game decides u lose a round,it's not game breaking,eu is beyond saving,well see, that's the beauty of a gamebreaking bug,gamebreaking bugs are gamebreaking because they happen during pivotal round deciding moments,and literally break the game,from a scenario you should win,to one where you guaranteed lose,because the game decides to,ya, u predict that the game will decide you loser,lose*,then you're correct,and lose,it's exactly what it sounds like,you counter something simple, like a shifu m2, a rook incap, a taya x strike,and it LITERALLY goes directly through it and hits you anyway,had it happen maybe 15 times ever,and they've all been on this patch,maylon = naruto in the waterfall (no spaces),AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA,,,its expected and reversible,o,<:PogChamp:269924172002492417>,Averse and ninjas went back to sleep,i'll team with some retards,if anyone

even reg for tournaments, nobody even knows who they are or anything,lol,and it isn't like they're some unknown superstar pro players,they're like, as bad as you'd expect,makes no sense,my first day playing i got placed in g12,hit g13 in like a week,hit g14 like 2 weeks after that,idk everyone's always been really bad at this game,nothing's changed,ur talking about grades and their relative skill level,im agreeing with iska that g12 was shit,and g13 was also shit,actually, even most of g14 was shit,but like, noticably LESS shit,still shit,if i see ONE MORE poloma player,talking about how diamond is top 500 and I can't call them bad,because according to math they're good,im gonna pop off,i shit on everyone,ur rank doesn't matter, ur skill doesn't even matter,i just dont lose,well except to rook,faggot char,rook is made to hit 3 shifu counters in a row, get 3 of his own counters baited in a row, then walk backwards in a line until he manages to hit an unreactable space at melee range after forcing you to counter with 50/50 guesses,then he combos you for 130 damage off it and gets mid,...repeat,it's RLY fun to play against,at least taya games i lose quickly,rook just walks backwards indefinitely,rounds are like 3 hours long,space is unreactable in melee range since good rooks are gonna cancel the animation at the end multiple times before doing the real one,you have to guess when he'll do it,ya, so you sit there hitting them because you have to punish them for fake spacing over and over,but then if they do a real space and interrupt you mid hit, you can't counter,on top of that, at any point they can just counter when you're trying to punish them and then he kills you anyway,rook absolutely rapes shifu,absurdly hard matchup,what dont u understand,rook is braindead,you spam cancel space to force people to burn outs, you can't simply not burn outs and hit him because 1. rook is super tanky and takes 0 damage. 2. it makes it easier for him to counter you/space since you're then forced to guess and if he times it appropriately you can't flick away in time,it's a flowchart my dog could do,Anyone can react to rook's space from long range you miserable monkey,good players hit C to cancel,do you know what C to cancel does,fucking rook player,it's waste of time,You must be joking.,Nobody's better than me,the only one who can beat me,is

Ever.,I've been a top player in almost every game I've ever touched,and I didn't play BLC,it has nothing to do with BLC,it's just talent.,Some people have it, most don't.,I have the most talent out of anyone,that's all,I was challenger in LoL and shit on a ton of LCS pros on their streams dozens of times,You not hearing about me isn't really my problem.,It's a big game.,Uni's not really my thing,occupations aren't really my thing either.,hansa,you shouldn't be disrespectful to someone you can't beat,you know?,show some respect to your superiors,The game is boring.,I like having fun.,What's wrong with being disrespectful to people who are inferior to you?,Who cares.,?,I couldn't care any less,Cause it's fun,I told you, I just like having fun,I guess that's one way of looking at it,but I don't really,The thing is, I play games for fun because I like competition,but it always ends up the same,I'm so good that there's no competition left,And then it becomes boring.,Like BR is right now,dunno, a few thousand,not that much,i was challenger,season 3,If your reference for my skill is from the discoheat video or whatever,I was on a smurf that was like, 2 weeks old.,I got permabanned a ton,No, I wasn't that good in season 2,only like plat,i got there somewhere near the middle/end of s3,when I was actually good,Oh please,you're a jade main,you should find someone from the bottom of the dumpster like you,No,Who're bewz and rifletown?,Last time I checked, they aren't me,so it doesn't matter what they think,even if they did agree with you,Well,the way things are, there'll never be a lan for this game anyway.,It's a shame, cause I wouldn't mind the money, and it would be nice to prove my point.,But it's the devs fault for being awful,<@164837543047593984> bttv,better twitch tv,you know,with the LUL,and other such memes,Eh?,My team is held together by nothing except my skill,attitude doesn't matter really,overrated,when my teammates see my play,they know we'll win,i don't have to say anything,Nah. Game balance is just a factor,I have to play against averse every day, he's far better than anyone in EU, and the 2nd best player behind me.,Unfortunately, taya counters shifu and is better in solo queue, rook also counters him and there's little you can do,fortunately for me, Averse is on my team, so we don't really have to worry about unfair game balance when we can just exploit it for our advantage instead,beating bad players with a 100% winrate doesn't matter if you haven't played against me,It's not hard to dodge the players better than you and win every game,it's the reason my winrate is what it is,,best shirt,i need to buy like,20 of them,wouldn't matter because ping makes the game unwinnable,our comp has 2 champs who need to reaction counter and 1 who needs to aim and reaction Q/E,we'd lose on that alone,that said, we'll play,just for fun,ya,skill doesn't matter with ping difference though,even a monkey knows that,,every day of the week,i was 40 hp,they were both 140,teammate dead,killed them both,lol,cus sirius ulted me after my polo gave them a free orb steal,classic uncarryable teammate,that i carry anyway,cus im me,o actually,they didn't ORB that round,i guess i stole them all,idk i prolly just lost hp cus u lose a ton of guaranteed hp in 1v2 in this game,that's why the game will die,it's impossible to truly outplay and carry, even if you play perfect,it's the biggest issue with the game rn,ya u just be the BLACK MAN,sirius,and u go,"m1",and take orb,it's a RLY good move,secret technique,founded by ninjas,exblack aka the pearl god,<:PogChamp:269924172002492417>  //,<:PogChamp:269924172002492417>,That song,is SourPls,^,i rate like,6/10,which is great for club music,dude ikr?,wtf that place seems lit,sign me up,BLC is a shit game for more reasons than mechanics,the game was poorly advertised, poorly balanced, with arguably the worst art style in any game ever released,The mechanics, idk how they were since I didn't play it, but my friends that did play it said it felt like shit and clunky,im not saying it was lower skill than BR or something,but BR could use a more BLC-esque skillcap,i dont think the skillcap was the problem in blc,is my point,ya nobody did,it peaked out at like 22 players,over it's entire lifetime,Im just saying the BLC player logic of "BR is a worse game than BLC that's more succesful because of the timing, budget, and steam support" isn't right.,BR is a better game than BLC for sure,but, it has issues that BLC did better,that's just my opinion,im saying from what I heard from probably about a dozen different people,it's not exactly a well educated opinion,im just regurgitating what people told me,and, from my experience with BR, i can imagine some of the things I complain about weren't as shit in BLC,from how BLC players have described the game to me,and from watching some gameplay of it,that's all,every time I speak at least 3-4 people start flaming and raging,and all 4 of them are verosk,and then people go "why are u so mad at arakune",[Redacted],and the shitshow starts,it's a good time,:^),oh ya i was definitely that guy,but i didn't scream,i lit shit on fire,it was sick,got arrested for arson,feels good man,because my persona is cool,are you denying that the "im an unbeatable god" persona isn't cool,it's cool inherently because you have to be at such a high skill level to pull it off to begin with,like, there's only 2-3 people in any game or scene that can have that attitude IF they want to,why would I not do it,it's so cool,i mean the skill ceiling for BR would be higher if it didn't have such unfair abilities.,Jade E, shifu incap, oldur petrify, Jade EXQ, croak deceit, rook R, etc etc,there's just a few abilities,that under the right circumstances,remove ALL skill from the game,ALL outplay,it's especially apparent in 1v2,you can be like, a full hp full energy shifu or jumong against 2 20% hp opponents playing like a rook/lucie or a poloma/varesh or an iva/whatever comp,and you will win 0% of the time,because your damage doesn't stick, you can't control mid, and they have enough CC to burn all your cds and then punish you after,even if you do everything right, you'll still lose,the game needs some kind of way to outplay scenarios like that,but it just doesn't exist rn,My propositon that I thought would be an interesting start is that if it was a 2v1 scenario, the 2 people getting orb wouldn't give them any benefit 0 energy 0 hp, you only get it so the one guy can't get it and make a comeback.,And that makes it so IF the one guy gets it,he can at least do something sometimes,and actually outplay them and win,idk how practical an idea like that is to balance, but they need some kind of change in that direction,something to keep "unwinnable situations" from happening,you know,Ya, faster speed and smaller hurtbox/hitboxes is a good first step to a potential 1v2 scenario like that was well, if you can juke literally everything there's some potential there for an outplay,the issue is really the orb,It's funny, because the purpose of the orb is to draw people towards the center and force people to play aggressive,but it actually does exactly the opposite,in 2v1 scenarios and even in a lot of 1v1 scenarios, one team has a guaranteed orb every time it comes up,so if you're behind on cds, you run backwards until orb is up and get it,if you're ahead on cds, you push them out of mid and don't chase, getting mid instead,it simply gives you way too much,I actually think making the orb do nothing in a 2v1 for the 2 would be SUCH a good change,for potential outplays and "clutch" situations,,ok,i am paladino,I respect europe it's a great country full of good men,sorry,TALANTED,ty maylon,ur words mean much,ULU,im still here,ya faggot bitch,hold,that,L,good morning eurofriends,,I don't know if I can remember feeling more bored than this,at any point in my life,i don't think i ever have been,there's nothing worth playing,nothing worth watching,there's not even anyone worth talking to,so bored,ending it is a poor decision,doesn't serve a practical purpose,not to mention it probably isn't very enjoyable,if there's an afterlife im not really interested in it,who cares,an afterlife where you can artificially do anything has no meaning,if you don't have to work for something, there's no point in having it,you know?,well, if it doesn't,then i'd still be the best like i am now,makes no difference,i wonder what's worth doing,i can't think of anything,the only thing i can think of that seems somewhat appealing,is trying to become good at chess again,but it's a lot of work,and idk if i want to put in the effort towards something i'm only 50/50 on,Like, it's not as if i actually care about being good at chess,it's just a time killer,i finished highschool forever ago,word,wanna play some chess?,pretty much what i figured.,wait a minute,i had a life altering revelation,i should interact with attractive women,when there's nothing else to do,it's the PERFECT timesink,im all in,well,at least u guys are fairly entertaining,actually nyy, i can't,I don't have enough space on my PC, hilariously,and there's no way to free up enough space either.,I don't have a dedicated harddrive, just an ssd,ya but i dont really know anything about computers,how 2 install harddrive,well actually if you had asked me like a year ago,i could build a computer from the ground up,but that was just cus i spent too much time on youtube tech channels,for some reason,i dont remember any of it now,idk,how do you forget anything?,ur brain deems the information not worth storing,gets rid of it,then how do u forget things?,so bored,i guess maybe i'll swim for like 6 hours today,the benefits of being in florida,bloods,are u mentally disabled?,what's your IQ?,do you have a learning disability?,im just curious,im one of those weird cases like einstein,im too smart for my own good,it's just how it is,i actually spend a lot of time,wishing i was dumber than i am,maybe then i could see eye to eye with people,and i wouldn't be so dominant in everything so i could actually get some joy out of my competitive drive,as it is right now, it's almost as if there's no point,Like, if I didn't learn and improve so much faster than everyone else, it would probably help with my personality and ego too,but that's not the world we live in,"the best here, except in games and IQ",...doesn't that default to nothing,like,what else is there,besides intelligence and skill,physical stuff is based on genetics though, it's not really a talent.,Although I guess intelligence is too,so fair enough.,zzz...,eh?,oh no,i've been bored this whole time,im trying to figure out what I want to do,waste of time,the only things worth doing are things you can be competitive at,learning practical skills that everyone can have isn't interesting or fun,it has to be something only you can do,See like, things like learning a language or making content or writing,some people find them interesting,but there's no real way to be competitive in those things,so i don't see the appeal,Nah.,You just find the most successful people and copy their style, people have already refined the system so you simply mimic the people who do the best if you really want to succeed in any kind of competitive sense. There's no skill in it.,i don't care about that kind of stuff,i'm not really about the betterment of society or other people,i just want to be the best at everything,See the probably is my goal is a catch 22.,I want to be the best,but once you become the best, you realize there's nothing left to do,and that it was a boring waste of time all along,The only time trying to become the best at something is fun is when you can't actually accomplish it.,But it's actually more frustrating than it is fun, even then.,Since you really do want to be the best,ya nyy, but I only try to do things I enjoy doing,I don't need to be the best at literally every conceivable thing,just the things i think are fun or cool,ya, exactly,it's fucked,it's like there's only 2 outcomes,try to become the best, be incapable of doing it, get mad that you can't do it,or try to become the best, succeed, and be bored since there's nothing left to accomplish,both scenarios suck,battlerite, rocket league at one point,i was probably the best trynd player on earth back in the LoL days,no, i am,im far better than everyone except averse,but averse is carried by his char,once taya gets nerfed it'll become clear,how insane i am,im the best player period,nobody is close to me,i've proven it a lot of times,believe me, if I wasn't sure I was the best, I'd be practicing every day like I used to,but there's no reason to anymore,it's a waste,i don't dodge EU tourneys, I oversleep because I don't care about them since the outcome is predetermined.,Like, I've overslept through every NA tournament for the last 2 weeks too,money isn't enough incentive for me to care,if I get guaranteed money for spending like 2 hours playing in a tournament,I'd rather not,It's a waste of my time.,Boring.,I had a pretty hot girlfriend,but we just stopped talking when battlerite came out,we never like, formally broke up or anything,i just stopped talking to her,completely,was too focused,<:swastika:269921950762008579>,<@150354957613268992> that job sucks,lol,rip,my buddy works the same job,says it's cancer,o word,doesn't sound so bad,<@192280862996430849> sorry i dont speak european,man,i wonder what seems so off,something just doesn't seem right,i feel like i should enjoy being good at stuff, but i don't,i wonder if it's just become too normal,it's like i feel like there isn't anything i can do you know?,i need competition,it's on the people around me,not me,I would if it wasn't impossible.,There's no point in a goal that can't be accomplished.,Like, I'm capable of anything that any other human is capable of, I'm that talented.,But it's not like it doesn't take a huge amount of effort,I don't want to put that much effort into something unless i really enjoy it,u know,i'm not talking shit,im stating facts,if i was talking shit, you'd know it,what does that mean,like,this is what i meant earlier when I said I wish i was dumber or less talented so I could understand people's point of view better,I can't even imagine a world where I don't talk about how amazing I am,like, I'm me.,If you were like me, you'd do the same thing,anyone would,it's common sense,It's based on facts, not opinion.,So, yes.,It doesn't matter what you think,or what anyone thinks,Of course I can.,That isn't on me, it's on lag and the game devs for not having lans,if it ever happened, I'd prove it easily,Something you have to understand is that I can tell how good someone is just by watching them play. There's only a finite amount of skill you can have in this game.,I'm at the highest point you can be at.,It's not as if other people can't also get there,but they wouldn't be better than me, just the same.,And I haven't seen anyone else there yet.,i mean, my arrogance is obviously a bit with a grain of salt,but it really is the truth that I can't imagine losing,maybe someone from EU will wake me up some day,you know the thing im actually most afraid of?,that a lan will happen,and i'll actually win,then what,honestly, if a lan were to happen and then i won,I think i'd quit the game.,There's no point competing in something where nobody can face you,not fun,You think?,I hope you're right.,Believe me, nobody would like the lose more than me,Well, that's not true. I probably hate losing more than anyone else, it's why I'm the way I am,but just the feeling of not knowing if I'll win or lose,i kind of miss it,If my team moved to EU, i doubt it'd make much difference.,the matches would certainly be closer than they are in NA, but that's only because they can't be any LESS close than us sweeping every single tournament 10-0 in finals,I doubt we'd lose.,Over 50% of adult americans are currently depressed or have been at some point.,As someone who was depressed at some point, I'm definitely not,I'm just without direction.,20.,Being extremely bored isn't the same as being depressed,But honestly, I'm not sure which is worse,🤔,Huh.,I just got outplayed and lost,I guess I haven't been playing much lately,well,at least this gives me something to do for a day or two,oh yeah,some shifu nerfs would be nice,then i'd really feel an urge to practice for once,taya's gonna get gutted,shifu will get a slap on the wrist,actually, that would be fun,nerf shifu hard enough that i have to play a new champ,then i'll have something to do,,nvm,those were the same peolpe who "outplayed" me the previous round,it was just cause it was my first game of the day,o well,i was actually pretty happy,but now it's eh,https://www.twitch.tv/iamarakune,z,ya,it's fixed,WutFace,<@161237820713861121> isn't that untrue since normally after a winning court case there's a seperate proceeding to pay for court fees?,Like, at least in the US, and depending on the type of case,I know that's a thing sometimes,IE: You take someone to court for something, you win, and then there's a seperate after the fact thing where the court charges the losing party for your court fees,my mom's said the same thing since i was like 6,always said i'd be a good lawyer,but idk,doesn't interest me,just competitive gaming,nothing else really,and competitive gaming as in like, competing in something in a sports-esque fashion that isn't a literal sport, because im out of shape and too lazy to be in shape,It doesn't have to be a video game,pretty much anything where i don't have to move,cus lazy,imo battlerite only has 2 huge issues right now,the orb is too op,and lucie exists.,fix those two things,and you've got a pretty good game,skill input only doesn't exist,because orb is so OP,and lucie exists,as I just said.,You aren't getting to the root of the problem.,orb and lucie both make it so when you make a mistake, your mistake has no meaning and the outcome is exactly the same as it would've been had you not made the mistake,That's what I mean.,So you should delete them.,Any truly talented player in this game can master a champ in under 100 games,for example, tahurtz,my varesh is better than yours,and averse's is almost better,even though neither of us play the char,No, you change the game by either removing the rune entirely, or making it do nothing in 2v1's,the biggest issue with this game by far is the amount of "unwinnable" scenarios,and they're all caused by orb, or by particularly op abilities, like EVERYTHING IN LUCIE'S KIT, or oldur petrify, shifu incap, jade exq, etc,they make it so when you outplay someone, it doesn't matter,and you still just die,Ya, i know it better than anyone else,the amount of rounds i've played legit flawlessly, zero mistakes in movement, positioning, just outplaying my opponents in general,and you just lose,with nothing you can do,it happens to me at least once every 2 or 3 games,cause my play is so good and so consistent,needs to never happen,if I play perfectly, I should win. Always.,Warden knows it all too well too,I got 1 for 8 fears against him,win anyway,there's plenty of scenarios that don't have anything to do with the RPS nature of champ matchups,sometimes, you lose no matter what.,It doesn't matter champ you're playing, what champ they're playing, what the HP or energy difference is, who gets orb,nothing. You just lose.,<@104272044069232640> noob,finlev defending me,WutFace,I never asked for this,LOL,Look, in my own defense,at least I spitball ideas,instead of just being like "this game sux blc better",I know what's wrong with the game from my point of view at least,and try to talk about it,instead of this vague shit,that doesn't do anything,To be fair fin, almost nobody likes battlerite in it's current state after putting in 500+ hours.,I don't see how anybody could.,Even big streamers like you and neewha barely play it,lol,Look, I don't see how "making the game more like blc" will solve anything,That game died for a reason,But you could argue it wasn't actually because of the mechanics,but the advertising, art style, and general jank in the game,If the mechanics of BR were more like BLC and the advertising didn't suck,well, you might actually have a great game,but idk, i didn't play blc.,btw im tired of battlerite so now im playing chess,anyone wanna play?,no,it's from watching gameplay of it,looks extremely clunky,it doesn't look,smooth,it looks,clunky,cause i looked at it,and it didn't look smooth,:/,like idk how to explain it to you,i watched the game and it didn't look smooth,there's not really anything else to say,a waste of time,downloading and playing a game that's dead is pointless,i don't need to form an opinion on it,cause it's bad,but what would that change?,I know my problems with battlerite.,I don't need to play another game to know them,actually,im pretty good at anything that requires high APM,i'd probably be better at BLC,than i am at BR,Keepo,well that was fun,i was bored of gaming, so i went to my extremely sick grandmother's house and watched her slowly die from dementia,\:D/,not rly very fun,demond,D E M O N D,I'm in Shimmering Sparkle division 3,i'll see YOU,in the TRIBUNAL,toxic PLAYER,T R I B U N A L,R,I,B,U,N,A,L,funny story, my friend back in the LoL days used to say that to every riven main after he killed them,like pre-level 6,he'd just go "I'll see YOU in the tribunal",and they'd always afk or feed or something every time,it was so good,<:PogChamp:269924172002492417>,ragingcherry,,,,YOLTZ,i missed u playing re7,how was it,THE FUTURE OF COMPETITIVE GAMING,guys,i have a legit question,i need to get a fulltime job within the next 3 months, which im ok with,but it's gonna eat into my ability to play battlerite,and the game's looking pretty doomed already,do i just quit,and do something else,or stick with it,cus family said,"get a job u damn hippie",so i said,"ok",no u dumb retard,im getting a job no matter what,the question was,is it worth it to try to stay at the top of BR,or should i do something more worth my time,since it's gonna be hard with a fulltime job,and game looks rip anyway,i mean.,do i?,cus if the game goes big it's guaranteed money for me,but like,idk if it will or not,or rather, it probably won't.,but should i take a chance on it,<@116561268147617793> nice me.me,xD,^^,legit ONE 10,000 dollar tournament in 2018 is probably worth continuing to stick with the game. I don't absolutely hate it, it just isn't particularly fun and having to practice to keep up with people will suck. I don't have to do it right now but I probably will have to in a month or two. or tomorrow if shifu gets nerfed.,I just doubt the game will even be that big,for one tournament of that size,i'd spend hundreds of hours for absolutely nothing if I deemed it fun,thousands, actually,life is short, you gotta do the things you enjoy doing.,It doesn't have to be fiscally responsible if you really enjoy it,and you can support yourself some other way,imo,for example, there's lots of people who work a full time job and then play something like poker or golf on the side,they aren't making money playing poker or golf, they aren't pros,it's just fun,im ok with being that guy,but with battlerite,...except BR isn't fun,so im HOPING there's some money in it,at some point,to make it worthwhile,RIOT GAMES BOUGHT SLS <:PogChamp:269924172002492417>,That's a given,I could've told you that,They'll do everything they can to keep the game alive as long as possible after f2p,but it won't last long,because the game sucks,that's reality,lol,tbh, it's worth sticking around just for now,More than the money, I really have wanted for a long time to prove that the words I say aren't just bullshit and I really am the best.,A LAN, with any prize pool, is worth staying for for me.,well, funny you say that,cause we've gotten several sponsorship offers already,and will probably sign with one this week.,ya, we've gotta work out contract details first.,i mean we got contacted by fnatic,but they aren't willing to do anything until f2p,<@98465602670186496> i would never do something like that man,SLS have sacrificed everything to bring you accommodation suitable for a battlerite professional,a lan would be pretty cool,im sure i'd get punched in the face a couple times,but i'd prove im the best,with my black eye,so worth,like, u can't have an ego as big as mine, and be 5 foot 7 and show up to lan and not get punched in the face,that said, i'd totally show up anyway,sometimes u gotta win it all,bet it all on black,I've been to lots of national SSBM tournaments and they're technically LANs but for a console game,they're like,the most fun thing i've ever seen,So much fun every time,just costs hundreds of dollars to attend them,so you can't really do them often,Like u just spend all day every day drunk af,chilling in hotel and walking the streets with the homies,it's so fun,but like,i've never been to a big tournament like that as like a legitimate competitor,i'm always just out day 1, RARELY day 2,and then you party super hard,idk how it would go if we were a legit team,HAHAHAHAHA,<@208693717563998209> HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA,<@179306091056726016> nah, average height in NA is like, 5'9 I think? I'm like 5'7 or 5'8,I'm just short,used to be a lot shorter,PogChamp,ya, everyone I know is way taller than me,it's life,My entire life at lan would just be making the OpieOP face while people take free pot shots at me,until they realize im a pretty cool guy and lay off,that's how it always goes,alternatively maylon would LITERALLY stab me,with like red and black face paint,and just scream loudly,for no reason,him and joltz,both shirtless,screaming at eachother,ROFL,flying out of FL is so expensive,my friends who fly from like a couple states away pay HALF the price for like, the same flight on the same airline,shit sucks,<@179306091056726016> OpieOP,fuck u pearl main,ur probably like 4 foot 2,and a girl,with a bowlcut,Real talk, where is dreamhack normally held?,Ik somewhere in sweden,I thought it was a big city,like stockholm yeah,lemme check my flight cost,lol,OH GOD,IT'S LIKE,ALMOST 1000 DOLLARS,LOL,NOT,LIKE,THIS,probably legal reasons,government's gotta make sure they don't shoot down ur plane, passports and shit,<@192280862996430849> u have rifle in name,fuk,dude for me to fly from like,here to new york,shit's like 400 bucks easily,to get to East coast it's like 600,alright real talk,if i went to a european LAN,what do u think the REALISTIC likelihood is,of me getting shot and killed,before even playing in the lan,like,i hate to be that guy,but like, im american and have never left america,europeans seem,SUPER violent,and like,more than violent,just actually fucking insane,like i could picture someone like maylon or joltz just having something snap in their head,and just killing like 60 people,for no reason,makes me kinda reluctant,Like, i can't imagine the pressure a normal pro player feels like, on the flight across the world to their first lan, having to compete in front of a huge crowd,imagine how much pressure i'd feel,not only with that,but being a short skinny guy everyone hates,worrying about dying,rofl,i mean, it's good to know i at least have some friends in the EU scene like joltz,but idk dude, i doubt joltz would jump in front of me if some whack nigga attacked me,nyy holy fuck,idk if i've ever met a pro gamer over the age of 30,and nyy's actually pretty good too,<:PogChamp:269924172002492417>,inb4 he's like 24,LOL,zab is old?,wtf?,<:zab:269928396509806592>,poor needad,dude,i actually think,i've become arrogant,ik u guys are gonna be like "ur just now realizing this, what in the godforsaken name of fuck",but real talk, most of the trash i talked about my skill and confidence and winning was real confidence,but me and averse both have hardly played the last 2 weeks,i played both yesterday and today, and im actually getting my ass kicked,by like, randoms,like,do you think i slacked off so hard,that people are actually catching up?,i feel like there's no way people could catch up that fast,let it be known,if lan happens,my public 12 page apology,will be on reddit,within hours,im trying to compete and be the best in the world,not die a hero,lol,i don't really care about fitting in,i just want respect for my skill,i don't care if people like me, i don't care if they dislike me, I don't care about anything except my own safety. My personal image doesn't matter much to me,I just want people to realize how skilled i am,and with no way to prove it, what can i do but talk,it's frustrating,do u want an actual picture?,there's one in the JD video,ok,,that's me on the right,playing ssb,ssbm*,but i got a haircut,it's like, military short now,so i look like nerd,for job hunting,which i ironically never did,I mean, I picked up a bunch of applications,but never filled them out,cus i was making that FAT battlerite money,but then 2v2 got cancelled and PRL and battlerekt had same timeslot,so now we're back to job hunting again,as that photo says, I live in tampa florida,or like, near it,30~ minutes away,it's a pretty ghetto city,but i live in like a lower-middle class neighborhood,i've been to texas 3 times for ssbm tournaments,it's not my kind of place,for example, everything is REALLY far apart,speed limit there is like, over 100km/h on highways,and it takes over an hour to get from one city to another,or frankly, from anywhere to anywhere else,it's ridiculous,texas is super super spread out,im in a weird spot man,i'm losing in battlerite, but i actually don't feel like im playing bad,i feel like im playing near perfect,it's just my opponents aren't making enough mistakes,and now the nature of the "unwinnable scenario" situations in the game,are coming up more and more often,i literally can't carry,against opponents who don't fuck up horribly,what am i supposed to do 🤔,Like, to put it like this, if i have my normal teammates of averse and ninjas, im confident we won't make enough individual mistakes that anyone will have to carry an unwinnable scenario, we'll just win every single game like we always do. I don't feel like we've lost any skill or that we're any less dangerous in a tournament,But in solo queue, I'm losing more and more,because people just aren't making heavily punishable mistakes,and it's like,what do,His pic is Arakune, actually.,,aka that guy,Arakune,maylon it's the beard,the thing is u have a pretty adult looking face, when u combine it with the facial hair you look like 30+,joltz doesn't look 30+ because he'd be babyface without the beard,so he looks like,25,o, ok,what do u look like then,cus the guy in ur pic looks like he'd stab me at lan,like 6 or 7 times,<@98465602670186496> isn't that what i look like?,look they say if u can't laugh at urself,what can u laugh at,i have the WORST picture of myself,of all time,from when i was like 17,it's fucking 🔥,,I need a haircut.jpg,me when i was 17,Actually, my hair was fucking raw,i should grow my hair out again,<:PogChamp:269924172002492417>,hey eoekas look,i'm not a super self-confident guy either,but im not like,self-conscious,every woman i've ever met says i look amazing,and i disagree but im like,"hey if you say so",we'll take it,ROFL,i really like this,making fun of ourselves,im glad i was the first one to post my retard pic out there,i can't wait for the incoming memes,*CRAWLING IN MY SKIN*,dude u know what,i miss bob ross,<:FeelsBadMan:269923546354941962>,<:zabbb:272527483994112001>,maylon,i feel less likely to be stabbed now,ty for ur contribution,EUROPEAN DJ KHALED,<:PogChamp:269924172002492417>,<:PogChamp:269924172002492417>,<:PogChamp:269924172002492417>,<:PogChamp:269924172002492417>,<:PogChamp:269924172002492417>,maylon = dj khaled,dude im ur #1 fan,can u get on a jetski and go,WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO,WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO,W E D A B E S,W E T A K I N O V A,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s76FrMMz5Tk,<@150354957613268992>,SourPls,dude this song was my shit when i was 13,i remember hanging out with this 16 year old kid cus he was older and i thought that was cool,and he said it was his favorite song,<:PogChamp:269924172002492417>,dude,being young was LIT,i mean im guess im still young,compared to most people in these kind of communities,but i feel old af,shit's gay,im tryna act like im perpetually 15,but im 20,zzzz,no like,it does,in the eyes of the law and people's opinions of you,there's a difference between "he's just a shithead 15 year old" and "this guy's actually a sociopath neet",even tho the reality is i just never grew up,well,i dont do anything else,i dropped out of highschool when i was 16 to be a pro gamer,like, that was why i dropped out,here i am,ya,i did "finish",i got my GED years ago,4.0 GPA,but i havent done anything with it,it's just there,chillin,actually, it is,For about the last 15 years,a GED is recognized by most colleges and all jobs as identical to a highschool diploma,it was changed at some point in the 90's to keep shitheads who made dumb decisions at 16 from destroying their entire lives,fortunate for me,so like, I could go to any community college, any tech school, and most entry level full time jobs right now with my GED,it isn't really seen as like "this guy's a lazy asshole who dropped out" or something,at least not nowadays,his father:  An American citizen by origin, he became Irish and later Norwegian. His father is Irish and his mother is Japanese.,>play like shit,>3-0 2 grand champions on the other team,>mfw,"bonus rating high league difference",great game,never fuck ur boy's sister,it's against the code,even if she's a fuckin dimepiece,that's how u get shot at lan,no,cus jeremy from the hood is gonna get shot in the back of the skull by my boy,not me,hold that,verosk is definitely just making shit up,verosk,i'll bet 100 bucks,right now,gamble time,ya,if ur changes are correct,i'll pay u,it's win/win,,<:PogChamp:269924172002492417>,real talk verosk,i bet u like,10 dollars,ur full of shit,if ur right, it means we have a reliable leak source,and i pay u,if not i get paid,win/win,fk u,it basically means,im paying u for leaks,so spill it fam,real talk though,no shifu nerf?,what in the fuck?,i was POSITIVE,he's the 2nd best champ behind taya,really,like, shifu's the 2nd best champ behind taya,and he's arguably more cancerous,like, the community wants him nerfed,super badly,whether he deserves it or not is another thing,wait wait wait,what about lucie?,please tell me she's getting gutted,like,removed from game gutted,lucie is the reason orb is cancer, lucie is the reason shifu and taya and jade and croak are all cancer,lucie is the root of ALL problems in this game,ALL,even if u change every other unfair ability,lucie will make certain champs insane,it's how she is,she's an enabler,she turns shifu from just an annoying sticky dps to an unkillable 1v2ing god,she turns taya from an annoying kiter with good mid control to a 200% movespeed spam uncatchable 1v2er who also gets every orb,she turns croak from an incap bot who's in trouble if he gets caught into someone who can deceit incap you from out of line of sight range AND he gets saved even if he fucks up,like lucie makes so many champs SO insane,so do u know anything about the rework?,like, if he looking trash?,not like this,i wonder who i'll main,if they make shifu non-aggro,i'll blow up sls studios,I mean shifu's a very very weird case,He reminds me a lot of lee sin,Absurdly strong kit, but no individual piece of it is op except the incap, it's only once you combine everything that you get this super versatile monster,You really have to be skilled with shifu to make him work, especially against his hard matchups,the only thing is that his ult is probably a bit too strong,Well shifu has a ton of sustain rn,i wonder if they'll make him more defensive?,im saying like,shifu can only be aggressive because of his super healing heavy rites,honestly, shifu probably has the strongest rites in the game,they're all insane,all 5 of them,and he has varied builds too,his kit has a lot of versatility, but he doesn't do enough damage, have enough damage/cc reduction, or enough healing without his rites,his rites and enablers like lucie are what make him truly op,if they change his rites, he might be godawful,but it depends what they do,actually,his round 2 and 4 are both situational,although 4 is only situational because of the known bug,actually,often times u learn when someone dies online months later,like, many many months later,3-12,im playing against a grand champion taya,who didn't take the round 3 tornado rite,AND im a losing,fucking LOL,I just lost round 5 in a 2v1,because my teammate died RIGHT as rook charged into my counter in melee range,but slowdown,so he just flicked and ran halfway across the map instead,with like 7 hp,then he used eat like 3 times,are u fucking kidding me sls,im SO mad,excuse me,rook,WHAT?,HE'S IN 90% OF GAMES,90%,90%,90%,"BUFFS",??????????????????,THE ONLY REASON HE DOESN'T HAVE LITERAL 100% WINRATE,IS BECAUSE TAYA DOES HAVE 100% WINRATE,AND COUNTERS HIM,HELLO,actually,they nerfed iva because she hard countered shifu\,and that shit is NOT allowed,shifu is literally the lee sin of this game,highest outplay potential, coolest champ, sick plays for ESPORTS,so they won't ever truly nerf him,not true,reddit polls showed like 93% of people wanted shifu nerfs or something,even more than taya,but he remains untouched,why?,because he's cool as fuck,so wait,shifu's getting no changes in the patch tomorrow,because they're reworking his rites in feb?,is that right?,u will tell me,u eurofuck,because it's vague,and i have 2200 shifu games,lol,Oh, I know.,In fact, I'll probably manage to make him work,because I have the best 2 teammates on earth,thank god,they'll carry my useless champ,whatever croak mains want nerfed gets nerfed,rip iva, rip shifu,rook buff,????????,my diamond teammate just 2v1'd and carried me,wtf,PogChamp,high rating bonus,Pog,dude,i can't WAIT,for jade to be killed,i've said for SO LONG that every jade player is so bad,i'm so happy,like, even if they gut shifu and make him unplayable,he'll be strong now,because jade was the hardest shifu counter in the game,and now with no exq,he's a neverending rape train,i can't wait to hold forward,twice as hard as i did before,and break my keyboard,holding forward,3000 players 0 good jades,jade only good in 3's jade only good with lucie,etc etc,she's like croak, she only works with a couple champs,but when she works, boy does she fucking work,that shit's straight unfair,The thing about jade's EXQ change is even if it does completely kill the champion, a rework on her exq and E was necessary, both of them fall under that category of "unfair abilities" i was talking about earlier with no counterplay potential that just are way too forgiving. If you make a mistake they save you from the mistake, and they make 2v1ing impossible, it's a good change. But there's 2 problems. 1. She needs some kind of compensation buff, just leaving her like that will make her nothing short of the worst champion in the game. And 2. Why would they do the exact OPPOSITE with other such unfair abilities, IE: Lowering the CD of rook's R, which is exactly the same kind of move? I don't understand why their logic for what's good and what isn't changed halfway through.,It's like their balance changes are just them throwing darts at a dart board,it seems like they're going in the right direction and then there's just 1 or 2 changes that makes NO sense and everyone's like "wait, what?" ie: taya last patch,inb4 nobody reads or responds to my legitimate wall of text,FeelsBadMan,me shifu,me m2,me 33 damage,ruhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh,to be fair, jade as she was before was insanely broken with the right teammates against the right comp. To the extent that there was nothing you could do. The same way lucie enables some champions (ironically lucie was one of said teammates, croak too.),But she needed a compensation buff,i can't understand these changes,unless the shield is absolutely HUGE,if it's like a 50 hp shield, maybe she'll be alright,but then she's arguably even more cancer, or exactly the same,eh... not terrible,But if she goes against our comp, for example,that 32 shield is gonna get melted instantly,OH WAIT,DOES IT NOT SAVE TEAMMATES FROM INCAP ANYMORE?,THAT SHIT,WAS SO,FUCKING,GAY,ACTUALLY,that was by far my biggest problemn,it wasn't just EXQ being a team immaterial, which is strong enough,you'd like incap 2 or 3 people, or pet them,boom instantly un-cc'd,she literally had a team immaterial that was ALSO clarity potion,like jesus christ what the fuck,so you know how everyone has their main's pov bias towards/against champs?,i have no problem with varesh,he's strong right now, but both jumong and shifu absolutely dumpster him,from my understanding, he shits on EVERYONE else though,like really badly,well that's what im asking,<@209695736806375425> 69,Actually, im pretty legit in the fgc,yeah, it's objective and based on MU spread and frame data,what im saying is,from my point of view as an experienced high level player, I see the counterplay to varesh and he doesn't seem OP.,but my 2 most played champs have good counterplay to him,im asking objectively,how insane he is,because to me,he seems like,only "strong",like, probably top 5 or 6 in the game,but not really op,manageable,ya,shifu turns varesh into fucking paste,shifu raping my varesh is the reason i mained shifu in the first place.,cause i was a varesh main,lol,it seemed like no matter what i did, I just died,keep in mind this was pre varesh buff AND pre shifu nerf,so back then it was actually brainless,and shifu just tore varesh's asshole apart,now it's a little harder,but i still think shifu wins,real talk,I wouldn't mind shifu being absolutely gutted,I think mastering a second champ and still winning with them would finally solidify my place as a good player and not just some "braindead shifu onetrick",after averse did it a lot of people respected him more,although he is just a fotm picker,there's nothing really wrong with it,it's a competitive game about winning,gotta respect it,Well nyy,it's because calling someone a fotm picker is undermining their individual skill,for example, finlev used to call averse a fotmer when he played poloma, before he started winning everything, and even once he started initially winning tournies with jumong,It's an excuse for losing to them and again, devalues the hard work that goes into being a skilled player,eventually fin admitted he was in fact a really good player, as you basically can't deny that now,but it's just like idk.. frustrating to work hard and feel like you're good and want respect for your results,and have someone go "he just plays this broken comp, it takes no skill, retarded champion",fin did the same thing with me and ninjas shifu/sirius comp, even though the comp actually has myriad counters and isn't even that good.,It loses to jumong/oldur, most things with taya, it loses to pearl/freya, it loses to rook lucie, etc,i could probably list a few more examples,i mean fin look, sometimes you say some shit and have to get called out on it, it happens to me all the time.,Well the players playing those comps think it beats our comp,and we think so too,if both parties think that's the case, it probably is.,Oldur/jumong in particular and pearl as a champ RAPE the comp,don't even get me started on freya vs sirius,poor sirius,but anyway this isn't a discussion worth having, so I'll digress,that's why people get mad at being called a fotmer though,it's an excuse for people to lose and to undermine your hard work and skill,it's not even a matter of insecurity,it's more just a matter of "I know im good and this guy is pretending im not good to make himself look/feel better about losing.",in particular is the person undermining you is another pro player, a streamer, anyone with an important opinion or audience,people will actually believe that whiney excuse making bullshit,and they'll undermine you too,so it's shitty,i probably get 10-20 people in my stream PER DAY calling me a shitty no skill shifu/sirius abusing fotmer etc etc one trick,braindead hold forward etc,even though my results have shown im well above the average pro player,it's not like im really hurt by those comments, they're just annoying,cause everyone wants respect u know,people want recognition they rightfully deserve for shit they work for,not that hard to figure out,<@98465602670186496> the goal of being a fotmer isn't to pick the strongest thing so you don't need to improve yourself to win. It's so that when you're the best player, you won't ever lose to someone worse than you because of unfair game balance.,It's not about beating players better than you without being better than them, it's about becoming the best in the world and never losing.,That's how I see it anyway,If you're the best player AND play the best champion, what can possibly stop you?,that's why averse is so scary,it's not as simple as "he's an amazing player, but i can at least give myself some edge with this favorable matchup",there is no favorable matchup,your only option is be better than him, or lose,and if he plays perfect,your ONLY option is to lose,competitive gaming,it's not really dick sucking,the last time i played him, i won,like over the course of the day,i think it's the first time i've ever had a positive record against him,won like 70% or so,ur ignoring the point,the point is that, at least within his region, he doesn't lose,it's because of a combination of the highest skill and fotm champ. It's not like he's actually a just decent player who wins because he's just decent and taya carries him the rest of the way,he truly is the best player in NA,it isn',isn't meatriding to state a fact*,Averse has been the best player NA since before I started playing,My first day in the game he was g15, and the only g15 in NA. ever.,He's changed chars twice since then and has never not dominated the entire scene,you could argue the NA scene is super weak,but me and ninjas in particular are super strong,and him and stro always beat us. Always. For 2+ months,even though i think stro was the worst of the 4 of us,he didn't queue with a g10 alt.,he queued with micdog on his main.,And micdog isn't that good.,Was like g12.,like, a legit g12,i was trashing him when i was g13,the point is averse carried him super hard and won,with poloma,who was admittedly broken as shit,but still,the point is he's still the only one who did it.,It says something if you're the only one to do something, but not just once, multiple times,yeah, i don't either,he's mad im stating facts about averse and calls it dick sucking,it's like how people say im like gloating all the time about my skill, all I do is state facts about my tournament and 1v1 performances against people,and people think im saying im the best player,if that's what the results say, there it is,He's averse,you should show some respect to your superiors,i mean frankly the only person you can make an argument for being better than averse is me. And the argument isn't a very good one,It basically comes down to jumong and taya winning the shifu matchup 1v1, and the fact that i sometimes go about even with him in solo queue. The most compelling evidence for me being better in a tournament sense is that him and ninjas played with condemned and not me, and lost round 1.,When our 3v3 team has never lost a single game and has 10-0'd every finals we've ever entered,implying that the difference maker was me,and im that dominant,I mean, I took a 2 week break from tournaments cause I decided to sleep,but I have a feeling you'll see tomorrow,you should watch the tourney, it's at around 9pm european time,me in tournament is nightmare fuel,PRL,3v3,They moved the timeslot,Nah, PRL gets a pretty good turnout,normally around 25 teams,but that was in 2v2,expecting probably around 15~,ya, on a wednesday,PRL is actually a pretty big TO,i used to compete in their rocket league tournies over a year ago,they're well known,and they pay out instantly,good seeding, decent commentary,it's actually an alright tourney,nyy look idk if u forget to take ur edgy 13 year old medication or something, but u shitting on everything is really gay,so stop doing it,u crybaby fuck,averse,me,prl,NA,literally everythnig,literally everything i say ur shitting on,for no reason,stop cry,look,i want u to acknowledge the word "stop",and then acknowledge the word "cry",zzzzz....,get on the game,i'll crush you,i didn't,i won more than 50% in an unwinnable matchup,that's why ur champ is getting nerfed and mine isn't,turns out,im better,i'll knock nyy out at lan,and he won't ever recover cause he's 70 years old,he'll die in hospital,joltz is on my side,LMAO,<:joltzieT:262452962897559552>,immediately before arakune x nyy

word,there's many people who maliciously hate me to the extent that they go out of their way with the sole intention of destroying my life,there's a lot of people far worse than me,i just talk a lot of shit and im cocky and people dont like it,more than that, im pretty rude to bad players i don't respect,which is like, 98% of people.,so,that said most people who just talk to me and im cool with know im a pretty legit guy,and like, i dont really care about convincing people,the people who talk to me know im cool, the people who don't talk to me assume im an asshole and i don't care since they're randoms,the only time it becomes an issue is when said randoms assume im an asshole and then actually take action to like, be an asshole towards me cause they think im an asshole,then it's like,ok,averse coaches people,i do too,im a legend dude,people are like "when do u take shifu's t2 snare over kunju battlerite",and i've gotten so sick of it,that im like,"20 bucks",ya,we're guaranteed to win,so u shouldn't bother regging,Nope, NA.,A bunch of EU teams are playing in it,just for funsies,I wouldn't be surprised to see one of the EU teams get 2nd,in particular joltz's team has a good shot imo,since they play a style we don't have in NA at all,and are clearly better individual players than the 2nd best team,the team to beat for EU is probably InTheFlesh/Vorime/Tahurtz,whoever beats them will get 2nd,and we'll 10-0 them in finals,it's the way it always goes,ya,we're unbeatable,we've 10-0'd every final for over a month,even when one or two of us don't show up,and we have to find a last minute worst replacement,lol,i told u, im not dodging them,they're at noon,and im a degen,so im NEVER up at noon,but i've been waking up at like,7-9

DAMAGE,BASED,SLS,dude that taya nerf,fucking hurts,averse jumong again <:PogChamp:269924172002492417>,Dude this is like,the best patch for shifu i've ever seen,lucie untouched, shifu untouched, rook pearl jade iva all nerfed, sirius buffed,taya nerfed,croak nerfed even,like holy shit,shifu best champion in the game?,by far?,the end is now,wait,holy shit,i just had a realization,if fucking,taya is meaningfully nerfed,i don't have an excuse for losing to averse anymore,time to be #1 NA,with my broken hero,Shifu's always been "top tier",I'd say depending on the popularity of the meta he's been as low as 4th or 5th,for example this rook heavy meta sucks for him, but it was counteracted because lucie's so strong,it's a weird case because lucie's always been the top of top tier for supports, she's a ridiculous enabler and her ult is a solo game winner, and lucie's best teammate has always been shifu,even if they nerfed shifu into the ground, as long as lucie is strong, shifu will be strong,jumong and ashka will definitely get buffs,shifu i doubt,<@98465602670186496> actually,it reduces r cooldown by 5 seconds, gives an iframe that can go over walls, and haste,pls,y'know im actually really shocked im saying this,but these patch notes actually look,really good,i dont know if there's a single thing on here i disagree with,the taya nerfs don't seem too over the top, just the right amount and her playstyle is the same,same with rook,and nyy u gotta understand that everyone has bias from their own main's pov,of course u dont think rook is an issue, and the reality is that rook doesn't win tournaments.,But it isn't because rook can't win tournaments, it's because there's no good rook players.,In the right hands, and specifically against any melee, he was absurdly strong,more than just absurdly strong, he was also completely braindead,a gold rook player could go 1 on 1 with me and sometimes win,because i'd react 0.2 seconds late to one m2 and get combo'd for 130 damage off it,then he'd just walk backwards,and secure every orb,that shit was gay,i only lose to things that are legit unfair,very very rare anyone outplays me,and in a game like this, there's lots of unfair and unwinnable scenarios where you can't do anything,probably happens like 30% of the time,<@99157649139986432> sorry grandpa,eyes goin,<@98465602670186496> nobody can look at things from an objective standpoint, everyone can try to put themselves in another player's shoes or to look at things objectively, but there's simply too many factors to consider, especially when you haven't played the scenario yourself.,oh wtf,he has a better shifu incap now,the thing about it was they said the knockback range was reduced by roughly 15%~,i wonder how meaningful it'll end up being,Yeah, i understand that,I'm saying you can be incorrectly biased simply due to your lack of understanding of a matchup or situation or mechanic,Like I can't explain to you why rook is so cancer for chars like croak, shifu, and sirius.,He just is,and if you played against it, you'd see it too,2 yeah,that's double charge right?,ya,er,wait,that's round 1 actually,it is, but m2 range is reduced by a fair amount and can't hit over walls anymore,R range reduced too,it's interesting because on paper, they actually took the exact wrong approach now that I look at it. It seems like they made his cancer incap and combo even stronger than it was before, but they nerfed some of the janky unfair shit in his kit and nerfed his berserk, which was honestly never the issue. A good rook never has to be berserk except when he hits his space on you to do everything he needs to do.,But who knows, the m2 range, the R range reduction etc might actually make a meaningful difference,It's just hard to tell looking at "1.9 range to 1.6" on paper,how much it means,he's the most surviable melee in the game,he has a 40 hp self heal on no cd and the ability to WALK BACKWARDS,WALK BACKWARDS,champs like shifu, bakko, and freya can't walk backwards,because they have no long range sustain,rook can just walk backwards forever,what are you gonna do about it,absolutely nothing,it's not like you're gonna chase the fucking rook player,because if you do he'll kill you,because you'll react slightly late to a single m2, or maybe he'll just randomly R you into the wall which you can't react to,and 100 hp is gone,and then what?,he walks backwards,walks backwards,walks backwards,i legit think if anyone with real legit mechanical skill played rook and just walked backwards with him and spammed eat,he'd be so ridiculously unfair,i mean, not on this patch as much,but nobody can chase him,what sticking to targets? that's not how you play rook,rook doesn't EVER go in,u walk backwards indefinitely,and space onto the orb to get berserk,and then you aoe clusterfuck everything,yeah, nobody wants to play rook that way,but i think if you did,he'd be cancer,even his hardest counter in the form of jumong doesn't have the chasing ability to go after him,he can't really engage on jumong,but jumong can't engage on him either,and he has better sustain,so what do you do against him?,i really think rook's playstyle is exactly the same in both 2v2 and 3v3,he's better in 2v2 tho,xd,xd,to be fair,lucie has like a 300 damage stunlock combo,it's F > Clarity potion,nyy ur weird,it's like u acknowledge that rook is cancer and know what's cancer about him,yet somehow still think he's awful,well, i dont wanna be that guy,but im not gonna be a backwards walking rook main to prove my point,i've seen people who aren't even good like devastation do it in 2's and it's absolutely cancer,you can't do anything,you can't ignore him when he engages on you, and you can't engage on him when he messed up either,the champ is so forgiving for him and so unforgiving for you,<@98465602670186496> literally everyone cause that's solo queue,stop using the argument "nobody cares about 2's",solo queue is the primary way the game is meant to be played,like i said, you need to strike a balance in the community,you need to balance the game around top level play,but that doesn't mean it's okay for solo queue and 2's to be completely unplayable garbage,why? Because that's what 90% of players play,and your game will die,it seems like they're trying to balance around 3v3 and competitive play for the most part, but they're nerfing the shit that's ABSOLUTE retard cancer in 2v2 just so not literally everyone quits who doesn't compete in tournaments,I think it's an okay balance,does it suck if you're a rook main? yes,does ANYONE else care? no,fuck rook mains,<:swastika:269921950762008579>,The problem is he isn't just a noob stomping 2's hero,he's just absurdly strong in 2v2,that's the truth,against some comps, he can basically 1v2 them by himself and has no way of losing,It was enough of a problem that a nerf was required, but it sucks ass that they have to nerf something that nobody's playing in tournaments,that said, when im playing solo queue and i see rook in 95% of my games, exclusively grand champions and they're players i don't recognize who are legit mashing counter off CD like some pre-hotfix platinum players,I mean, something's gotta be done about it,what about the players who ARENT as good as is,us*,when they play against that shit,they'll just quit,because if it doesn't feel fair to me as a top level shifu main,it definitely isn't gonna feel fair to croakplayer69420,I just think you have to see it from everyone's perspective is all,rook was cancer to play against even if you were really good depending on the champ you were playing, and it was a good deal of the cast,if you WEREN'T really good,rook was probably enough to make you uninstall,whether or not he's performing well in tournaments does matter for balance, but what do you think noobs care about more, the one tournament they watched last week, or literally 90% of their solo queue games that they've played against noname rook players that even they can tell aren't good,but shitstomp them every single game,he's just too pubstompy,I suppose that's fair. If you remove the 2v2 gamemode from the game and make solo queue 3v3 exclusive,we probably wouldn't be having this discussion,I still think the changes to rook make not much sense though. Like it seems like all they did was make his sustain, poke, etc weaker than they were, and make him even better against melees because of the new improved incap and charge rite,Like, who is that helping?,ranged champs already raped rook, and now melees get 3.5 second incapped instead more often?,like who is that targetted at,lol,wait wait wait,"raging bull, gains 1 ability charge",wait,what am i reading,he can triple space now?,OH,it's still only 2,i was about,to hang myself,i thought it meant gains an ability charge from last patch,so now it was 2,rofl,"boulder toss inflicts a 1.5 second fading snare",aaaaaaaa,AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA,AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA,to be fair,rook already destroyed taya,last patch,he was the only char in the game that beat her,ask averse he'll tell u the same thing,rook was cancer for taya,rook was legit cancer for like everyone in the game except for sirius, jumong, and jade,o ya,varesh dumpsters rook,well taya wasn't bad against anything,i mean,it was taya,<@250636384774127616> you m2 him from halfway across the map and then R him from WAY out of the range,because LUL,Not after taya q you retard rook main monkey fuck,you stand at middle range, outside her Q range and m2,because it was 1.9 range,aka like, 4 full rooks away,and it still hits her,and R ALSO still hits her after it,for some reason,shit's so gay when you get max range rook m2 stunned and you're like "at least he can't incap cause it won't reach",nope,it still reaches,somehow,even though his club doesn't even touch you,eh, it is and it isn't.,The nerfs are all hard to visualize on paper, how much of a nerf is 1.9 m2 range to 1.6. How much is the R knockback reduction from 5.9 to like 4.7 or whatever,it's hard to say,it could actually be a huge nerf, at least against range,But against melee I think he's even stronger probably,im telling u as someone who plays over 90% of my games against rook,i know the char better than u do,and he's gay,deserved nerf,no,i did,and that's only because we've never not 5-0'd a rook,i mean i literally have 2200 shifu games,which means, according to math,i've played 2197 games against rook,which is more than anyone else,to be fair,my opinions on game balance havent been wrong a single time since the release of the game,and pretty much aren't ever wrong in any game,i should rly just make a game,not interested,i'd do it more just to prove a point,"More

<:FeelsBadMan:269923546354941962>,Well,my boy averse is going back to the H U N T E R,the NA god comp,returns,shifu/sirius/jumong,probably the best comp in the game this patch,every one of the counters to it got nerfed,and sirius got buffed,that shit is NUTTY,sup,i didn't,i overslept,NA <:LUL:269941798107873286>,ROFL,rook = gay champ (no space),i like paladins,ROFL lol,fucking fahros,does nothing but cry,about croak/jade nerfs,"jade mains deserved it",fucking K E K,P A L A D I N O S,can i play some paladinos,ya,to be fair it is a mechanic,u can cancel the meter as it's draining if u still have enough meter for an ex,it's not that good except situational,since most of the time u want the full ult,the refund was broken tho,SLS has sacrificed EVERYTHING to nerf rook by buffing him,it took,so long,ya it's not like we've been the best for like,3+ months,or something,and will be until time itself ends,literally,blankz,hotbiscuit and wuzac are scary dude,u suck tho,suck,<@227161493227962370> i love nikita,well like,everyone except like 15~ people suck,...globally,so yes,:nobully:,🇷🇺,me averse ninjas stro condemned corrupted klerny joltz blankz wuzac

shit talking faggot fuck,you think i dont see you in PRL chat constantly talking about how NA would stand no chance on EU ping and how "come to EU if you wanna see tight matches",shut your bitch ass,the fuck up,you trash fuckin player,he is good,he's one of 12 players on earth that could take 1 round off our team,congrats,you're worse than us by less than everyone else,jade nerf says enough,not anymore u cant,:babyrage:,InTheTrashChampion,<:FeelsBadMan:269923546354941962>,shifu's way too cool to get nerfed,he's lee sin,but with a spear,10/10,honestly conceptually jumong is cooler than shifu,but his playstyle is so gay\,i just want corrupted,to 1v1 me,and get raped,even averse was talking about like, ok, people think NA is arrogant, even tho we're not and actively admit we probably wouldn't win an EU tournament,but the opposite is actually true,EU is SO fucking cocky,never shuts the fuck up about how much better their region is and how it's more stacked and how they have so many better teams and how we only look good cause we have no competition,like dude,nobody in EU has taken one game off of us,what are u even talking about,get ur head out of ur ass,and prove u aren't shit,EU teams losing to other EU teams that we 10-0,gtfo,who cares how many good teams u have in EU,we'd beat all of them for sure,ya no shit,but u know what's harder?,losing to a team worse than u,only true if ur playing against croak,cus 1 mistake means u die,and it isn't even necessarily a mistake,since he's so hard to track in stealth,insane champ in 3v3,but both wuzac/hotbiscuit/blankz and teldo/verosk/mini are super carried by how broken croak is and how braindead the followup is,i could find a grade 11 player who could snipe and ashka Q when people deceit incap,give me a fucking break,0 mechanical skill,literally 0,entire comp wuzac/hotbiscuit/blankz run is literally spam croak stealth, hope they don't guess who he's going for correctly, kill them off a single stun if you guess correctly, if not, croak leaps over a wall, blankz infests ashka and ashka spaces over a wall, regroup and try again,it's just the most forgiving comp for them and unforgiving for opponent comp that could possibly exist in the game,braindead,ya but playing a low risk high reward comp,and winning with it,doesn't mean ur good,it means ur opponents are bad,u know what happens if u play a low risk high reward comp against really good players?,they just dont make any mistakes,and eventually after you reset neutral 6 times cause you keep fucking up,we've gotten 2-3 orbs and double ult you,and you lose,wow,outplayed,the point is,EU sucks, carried by croak + braindead followup,the only good players in EU,are the croak players themselves,for constantly managing to position so well that u can't punish them,even when u outplay them,joltz is playing rook and ezmo,shoot myself in head,shifu is one of the easiest chars to punish in the game,there's a reason no other shifu stands a chance against me,i realize how exploitable the champ is if u outplay him,plenty of champs u cant do anything against even if u do outplay them,?,u dont ask for respect,you demand it,only trash like u asks for respect,i get it just for breathing,nyy what the fuck are you talking about btw,im not shitting on other people until corrupted is first,faggot talks shit nonstop about how bad NA is,when i'd absolutely rape him 1v1,and my team would rape his,he stands no chance in any world,yet has the audacity to talk shit,from the fucking cave he lives in,we're playing champs that require skill it's not plausible for us to beat anyone good like it is with croak/jade/ashka playing retards,on that ping,do u not understand?,you can't play 2 counter reliant champs and someone who has to actually aim, champs who have to rotate and position appropriately,on 150 ping?,no,it doesn't,because a croak/ashka comp on 8000 ping can still 100-0 someone off one deceit incap,100% of the tmie,i could train my dog to do it,i wish our 3v3 comp was as easy as hitting one button per champion and bursting people from full hp. From stealth. When they can't predict who we're going for,but we have to actually outplay them,with reactions,reads,and skill,wow,shocking,to be fair,there's no point in doing something if you aren't the best at it,joltz,waste of time,it's just a competitive mindset,i guess it's something u guys don't have,the goal of all things is to win,winning = purpose in life,because life's about having fun,and winning is fun,losing isn't,ez,im gonna literally wait,right here,until corrupted gets on,and then im gonna beat him 5-0 in 1v1 over and over,on EU servers,until he quits,it's not actually possible if he was the same skill as me cause of ping,but let's be real,nobody's the same skill as me,nobody would ever approach,it would have to start in sudden death,i want corrupted,it would've been one thing if he was a memer like everyone else and said "eu > na xd" one time,it's another to spam an entire tournament chat for 3 hours,talking about how much better ur region is,i'll actually remove this motherfucker from the game,rape,honestly,if corrupted isn't here,i'll prove my point,anyone in your entire shit region,1v1, EU ping,i don't care who,i'll prove how superior i am,i'm done with this,ya,i don't care,i'll crush you,😄,why would i be friendly and nice,to such bad players,who are so arrogant,if corrupted is so sure he can beat me,i'd love to see him try,instead of being subhuman trash, literally being a stream monster crying about gamebalance and EU vs NA in twitch chat instead of playing the game,why doesn't he actually prove me wrong,as a matter of fact, why don't any of the hundreds of people who think im bad and cocky prove me wrong?,oh that's right,they can't,frankly,this place is a war zone until i get corrupted to either quit the game,or suck my dick,i hope so,"i dont condone leaking",stopped reading,i just want,to destroy corrupted,in game,give corrupted,thats ok,i'll wait,i wait,😃,look,if ur gonna talk shit about not just me,but my team,my country,i'll not only talk shit about u,i'll talk shit about ur family,ur country,i'll fuck your mother's face in front of u,after i 5-0 you on ur shit server,o ok,can i have picture,oh,ok,no u,well that was in reference to corrupted,i cannot fuck my own friend's mother's face,tm,at least not for free,C A P I T A L I S M,ULU,ya they lowered high league difference,used to be minimum 30 maximum 41,but i won 3-0 with a diamond vs double gc,got +16,they changed it in the patch,idk they're still tweaking it,tbh it seems better now,a "big" win is about as much as a loss,and u should have well over 50% winrate to move up,the normal gains seem higher too. ...sometimes,like averse was gaining 8-10 for normal wins,but now he's back down to 5 like me,no idea why it was more for a while,ya',it's ruined now,but if they reset with the system now it'd be a bit harder,the best part,is that the patch is actually such a good patch,i have no complaints,turns out,shit's not reversible,🤔,"ok guys, we're gonna take a vacation for a month and then we're gonna implement all these important changes that need to be in before literally everyone quits.","well uh, what if we take a vacation for TWO months instead, say all the changes are in, and only put in like half of them?","I like the way you think","guys look at this patch, it has all the things people asked for in them!","..well those are just the patch NOTES. the actual patch has like half of them",>doesnt add features later,gotta make it easier to get GC,gotta find dante,sls irl,<:swastika:269921950762008579>,W H I T E S T E E

it was gonna be that way permanently,and i dont go into dentist for like 3 weeks,had a NotLikeThis moment,dentist is death,but i needed like 17 root canals 40 crowns and a couple dozen cavities filled,so shit happens,u know,go there every 2-3 months,for like,3 years,i used to go every 2 weeks for like the first 6 months or so,to get the urgent stuff out of the way,ya i was in the same boat,then i went in after drinking 15+ cans of soda a day for like 8 years,and they were like "well u completely destroyed ur teeth","that'll be 50,000 dollars",so now i dont drink soda anymore,😄,maynelon,called my dentist to ask about tooth pain,and they're like "uh, is it the 2nd tooth from the right?",and i was like "wow, that's a really good guess",and they were like "oh we already did a root canal on that, so it being in pain makes zero logical sense","you probably fractured it",nice,the question is,if they already did a root canal on it,how the fuck did they guess it was that tooth,without me telling them anything,what'd they just let me walk out of there being like "ya that tooth's probably gonna break in half soon","o well",mfw,dude obamacare,dont even get me

after 1 or 2 hours DOES not mean they're having less fun",yes it,does,?,i played 16 hours a day for 1000 hours straight,just like averse,in the last 2 months, me and averse have both put in like 200 hours a piece,"not having less fun",yes i am,gaz aren't u the leakerlegendxx69,?,i've decided what my least favorite thing in BR is,it's when im getting orb with shifu by doing 3 m1's to m2, there's no way the other team can contest it cause they're zoned out away from it and im bodyblocking, no way they can steal, mathematically impossible,and my teammate just decides for NO REASON to m1 the orb and they steal it,just had a game as shifu/oldur vs croak/jumong where we got 0 orbs in 4 rounds,cus this guy wouldn't stop touching the fuckin orb,what in the actual fuck,can i just queue up for

showed up,but christ,just to be clear btw,it probably won't be that entertaining to watch,we're gonna get blown out without averse in round 3 by project horizon,well we got a bye,so literally cant

the 2nd match,to delay as long as possible for averse,but i doubt he'll show up,i'll kill averse,😄,tells me to make sure im awake,doesn't show up himself,TWICE in a row,this dumb faggot has an entire week to fix his sleep schedule,TWICE,doesn't do it either time,no self discipline,no respect,actual retard,have some respect for ur teammates,is the only point,idc what u do,dont make me wake up at 10am on a saturday,and sleep in,like a faggot,look it's ok to have it happen once,especially last week,he was up all night, we only decided on doing the EU tourney like 2 days before,he only got like a 2 1/2 hour nap before the tourney,sure, i get it,yesterday he got off at 2am,still doesn't show up,????????,the thing that makes me the angriest,is he emphasized SEVERAL times to me like,"make sure you're awake and have enough time to warm up",then he doesn't show up,????????????,this conversation was less than 12 hours ago,im pretty tempted to just find a different third for the NA tourney today,win,and then pay him fucking nothing,made me wake up early AND made my formerly undefeated record get 6-0'd in semis,fuck,him,quarters*,ya,we got 6-0'd,because I had to find a replacement on literally,LITERALLY,20 seconds of notice,wuzac/hotbiscuit/blankz,i'll make sure to write that on your gravestone,6-0.,3-0, 3-0,it's the battlerekt format,doesn't help that ninjas got 43 damage like, 4 different rounds too,i literally 1v3'd them,on 150 ping,ended with round mvp like half the rounds,while one teammate was useless,and the other was afk,so disgusting,i outplayed them legit 1v3,so many times,on 150 ping,didnt win a single round,where's averse,im gonna rage at him for like,months,Like at this point it's the principle.,It's an hour and a half after the tournament started,did he not even consider we'd try to stall for him?,Where the fuck is he,i havent felt this salty in a minute,where the fuck is averse.,u cared an awful lot about me joining the tournament,shut your fat hypocrite ass the fuck up maylon,you seem obese,not even from NA,go for a run,fat fuck,if you can even get out of your chair,impressive to be physically and mentally disabled,running's very bad for

been paid,a n y t h i n g a t a l l,As a matter of fact, it's funny you bring it up,because after asking literally a dozen times and getting the "within 1-2 weeks because we hit an unexpected snag or some information was wrong or something" thing,the very last email i got was,"yes, all the money has been sent to you, you're waiting on paypal turnaround time.",They've said in the past paypal turnaround time is 3-5 days,And today is day 5.,So it's time to pop off,ya, they did eoekas,but they cancelled it,then resent it to my correct account.,Supposedly.,5 days ago.,I still don't have it.,thank god me and ninjas are here,we'll probably still win this tournament,but if my 3 month winstreak gets ended, AND i don't get my money, AND i woke up at 10am on a saturday all at the same

need this game,Peacekeeper,orochi is so fucking FILTHY tho,i need it,i'ma play it for sure,at some pointy,point*,im better than joltz,but he's pretty good,best warden i ran into,keep in mind this is from our scrubby <50 hours in the game pov,all of us, joltz, me, averse,cus we suck,but ya,game's pretty raw,oh dude,oh,DUDE,i'm in it,im about to put,10k hours,into this game,the game is literally,raw,in game form,no such thing as moba,ONLY 1v1 and 2v2,dick measuring competition the game,orochi mirrors,hmu,I mean same,but orochi's so fucking filthy,like if averse didnt main orochi and I wasn't already dedicated to PK because I just wanted to stick with 1 char for the free weekend so i could hopefully become half decent (which i did, imo),i'd be all over it,orochi and all the samurai classes are sick,I started on kenshi or whatever,but only played like 3 games before playing PK,averse told it was OP,that was the end of that,i didn't get good enough in the beta to really utilize all of the tools she has available,but even without all of them she felt super good,well it's crazier than parry > guardbreak is a true combo,40% hp per parry,and she has deflect + hella mobility,the thing about the char is that it's meant to be like a counter attacker where your weakness is that most of your damage applies in dots and takes time to work,the issue is that it's defensive options are so good and it's so fast that not only can it also win straight up trades most of the time, but also when you apply the bleed, staying away from people long enough for the damage to go through is hilariously easy,On top of that, since the poison does more damage than a normal move since it's "weakness" is being a dot,She's just super fast super high damage super safe,no real weakness besides how insanely squishy she is,sometimes one missed parry was like 80% of ur hp,but if u play the char right,she's nuts,warlord,W A R L O R D,shit's op ya,PK, warlord, orochi and a couple others were good,i heard valk was amazing,but she wasn't in this last beta,i also heard PK got nerfed,after this last beta ended,rip PK,i wouldn't mind,she seems fun,but I'll main any super fast class,or any char with a sword honestly,zerker seemed raw to me,and my buddy zyko is a beast at him,agree,dude im playng LoL,aka,time killer,the game,teldo's face is so

Hi, I'm Haldvar. I approve this thread.
Yours, Haldvar.,I'm laughing so hard,Holy shit,someone replied to my wall of text rant thread,with their own even larger and girthier wall of text,and it just agrees with me and the guy understands what im talking about 100%,he has 1200 games on one char and 500 hours, GC (not that it means anything),it's almost like every decent player,sees the same thing,it's just that decent players are a very small minority,because the game is so easy,🤔,dude im so easily baitable,i almost just wrote like 4 sentences explaining why that was dumb,even 100% aware you're memeing,i just feel this NEED to inform people,zzz,"In many cases there is literally only 1 option in an approach, followed by a single layer variable which decides the result of the fight. After I reached Grand Champion, I had a losing streak, and a few times during matches I just stopped playing.

I'm Verosk.
Yours, Verosk,i talked with neewha about it again,i've never seen a game that plays itself more than this one,and neewha was like,even if ur right,who cares,so they make the skillcap higher and keep the 40 pro players from quitting,what about the other 500,000 that quit before they reached the skillcap,just cus ur a pro doesn't mean u have insight on what will keep casuals playing,and u dont have the answer,etc,that was his logic,and like, i get it,but also improving the competitive aspect of the game in a healthy way improves the game for competitive and casual players, in a game like league the players who never care about improving have aram, they have a shitload of champions, but most important of all, they have items, troll builds, and unique "for fun" gimmicky stupid shit to give the game that feeling of "endless replayability",Something battlerite will never have, by design.,Even if you're IGNORING people who care about improvement and who care about the skill, casuals won't come back without gameplay variance. Nobody wants to play the same scenario over and over an infinite amount of times, whether you care about being pro or not.,And that's why fixing the flowchartiness of gameplay not only helps pros, but noobs too,people just want to be able to try new shit and feel like game 1 is different from game 2,if game 1 and game 2 are the same, people are way less likely to play 100 games,u know,i agree with u,tfw blood doesn't read what i say and proceeds to say exactly the same thing,"BLC, csgo and games like those arent as repetitive as battlerite",that's why casuals AND pros quit,people of ALL skill levels,and adding depth and more interesting dynamic decision making makes the game higher skillcap, and gives noob casual retards more gameplay variance and replay value in general,nobody loses in that scenario imo.,nah,imo there's no question of "what's the next game",i've never felt more sure about anything in my life,than i feel about for honor,for honor's gonna be fucking huge,and more than that,it's so fun,it's SO fun,i could put in 3000 hours easily and not get bored.,It's the first game I've played in forever that brings me back to my highschool days of going to school, coming home, and netplaying people in blazblue on xbox 360 for like 12 hours a day,I feel like even after putting in 2000 hours, mastering the game and my main, I'd have just as much fun learning a second char, and a third,etc,the game is 🔥,xaynox and bloods don't take this the wrong way, but u guys are too bad at the game to experience the game that me, ninjas, neewha, joltz, teldo, verosk, and a lot of the true elite players see the game,im not saying you're far off,but speculating about what exactly is wrong is pointless, since we've already pinpointed it down to an exact science.,In fact,someone pinpointed it to one paragraph.,xaynox,i'd wipe the floor with you and everyone in EU,no contest,i'd crush you under the iron fist of trump,"u are NA garb one trick ponny. No offence",Fucking europeans dude,here's a thought,you suck faggot, fucking blow me,no offense.,im not a joke,im unbeatable,it has nothing to do with character,comp,or any other thing,i simply am me,and i don't lose,that's the world we live in,Get over it.,Kaceytron, like europe, lacks any kind of meaningful accomplishments anyone should care about.,"In many cases there is literally only 1 option in an approach, followed by a single layer variable which decides the result of the fight. After I reached Grand Champion, I had a losing streak, and a few times during matches I just stopped playing.

I literally have a google document on Bakko matchups and rules, and they are extremely simple. It’s win or lose all. That is “individual skill” in BR, memorization.",There you go.,That's what's wrong with battlerite.,Summed up in one easy to read paragraph even a euro can understand.,And that paragraph,is the same reason I'll never lose to anyone,even without practicing,even without playing well,The game plays itself.,beating me is mathematically impossible,there isn't room for human error in the game.,It doesn't exist.,You didn't "beated" anything you miserable degenerate fuck,what are you talking about?,You won 5-4 on EU in a MU i have no experience in and I smashed you 5-0 on NA,Shifu's the highest skillcap champion in the game.,And you know how much skill he takes?,None, still.,That's what battlerite is.,regardless,a bird i know told me the new champ is going to be a stronger version of shifu,so I'll main him next patch instead.,Just to prove the point of how superior I am,As I've done countless times.,You don't understand,I already know the next champion,<:LUL:269941798107873286>,the reality is, as I said.,I cannot lose,The game doesn't have room for me to lose,Even if the game did have room for me to lose, I'm not bad enough at such a simple game to make enough mistakes for people to win.,In fact, nobody on my team is.,So there's no way anyone will ever beat us.,It's just how it is.,But I got sponsored today.,And nobody from EU did.,🤔,Idk, are there sponsored EU players?,Did I miss the news?,LOL hotbiscuit,Hotbiscuit has less skill in his body than I have in the tip of my dick,This is just it,you eu trash are all so misinformed,people saying "averse lost on EU, he's a fraud" or "Legendary got 6-0'd by project horizon" or "Eu won an NA tournament" all of you have the wrong idea,With our full roster, our team has never even lost a game, let alone a match.,Any case where anyone except us wins means one thing and one thing only.,We didn't enter the tournament.,That's it.,Well, klerny's also better than all of you.,So I don't see what's so bad about the comparison.,Eh? I didn't say I didn't play serious.,Read again you worthless garbage, I said our full team has Never.,Lost.,One.,Game.,<@158305555037945856> I'd ask you to 1v1, but I'd crush you and it wouldn't have anything to do with skill.,All I'll say is what I've said from the start,You guys are lucky this game doesn't have BLC's skillcap,Because there would be no competition.,The chance of me losing would be 0%,bloods,what rank are you again?,in a game that plays itself and you dont need any skill?,did you even get gc?,u won on ur server,I crushed u 5-0 on NA,then you picked freya,And I crushed you 5-0 again.,<@98465602670186496> that's because the game doesn't take skill.,Condemned, joltz, xaynox all got games off my shifu on EU ping.,You don't really think they're even close to my skill, do you?,You must be joking.,They are.,I've said it once, I'll say it 1000 times.,The game plays itself.,There is no skill in it.,You played freya against me already xaynox,You lost 5-0,In front of all of EU,everyone watched the match,It was streamed.,It was winghaven's stream.,What's the link?,there's no showdown,the game takes no skill,im asking,what his twitch channel's name is,winghaven's.,Xaynox remembers the vod was deleted right?,because I was beefing with chat and called them all faggots,specifically told wing to delete it,that wasn't it,i asked for him to delete it,lol,then i rest my case,xaynox got raped,and even though i havent played otuside a tournament in 2 weeks,I'd do it again,What do they put in the water in EU,how are you in such denial?,I raped you and even nyy who hates me remembers it,Are you braindead?,nyy,was,there,joltz was there,wing was there,blankkz was there,zab was there,everyone remembers you braindead meatsack,and if you're gonna sit here and deny it,i'll put you in your place right now,again,5-0,shifu vs freya,i dont even touch you this game,i'll show u how shit u are,right now,get on the game,xaynox,ur trash,you'll always be trash,you, your family, your country, everything you stand for,is trash,you're worth less than the dirt you and your disgusting mother sleep in,you uneducated,worthless,pig,fuck,what lan?,the game is already dead,period,the fact that the skill ceiling is so low i can't crush everyone in EU onesidedly says enough,dont have any,o that?,the qualifier for LAN thing?,i don't really care,i can do whatever i want,xaynox apparently also has less than a 2 week short term memory,so he wont remember i said anything,braindead fuck,It is deleted,you were there,everyone was there, actually.,I'm sure joltz or blankkz or anyone you ask,will describe to you the gruesome rape i inflicted on you,i want you to know,out of the dozens of people i've 1v1'd,you're the only person to get 5-0'd and ask me for another match,the hilarious thing,is you got 5-0'd again,learn your place.,i did show it, with many viewers,all of which i called shit,You're forgetting the most important piece of the puzzle,With no video evidence, it's easy to simply take his side and say that I'm lying and it went the opposite of the way it actually went,you forget the most important part,I'm me,and I still don't lose,so we just play again,and the outcome is exactly the same,we could play 1 game, 10,10,000.,It will always be the same.,Oh I won't.,In fact I'll post it on reddit,"Arakune crushes European trash player who talks shit","NA > EU",Trump smashes europe,Are you implying he didn't talk shit?,He called me a trash one trick unwarranted,the saddest thing,is i shit on him,so hard,I can say whatever I want,I'm the better player.,Sure, but saying lies makes your word meaningless.,Nothing I've said has been wrong.,So my word has value,when do u get off work,i'll be waiting here,ur not getting out of this one,ya,welcome to no skill game,37% of games mathematically impossible to carry,hence my less than 100% winrate,because those are the games I've lost,I can't think of a single time I've lost and it's been my fault in over 3 months,yet i'm losing 30% or so of games.,It's the nature of battlerite.,I've said it already, playing on a server with the same ping defeats the entire purpose of the competition.,I can't lose.,I've shown it a dozen times,what makes you think i won't show it 1000 more?,You know how much i love flexing,honestly,i wish players like you would talk shit more often,it might be my favorite thing,having an excuse to insult people, then destroy them in game, then insult them more,i couldn't ask for anything more,Randler sure.,My confidence is so overwhelming.,I'm certain i'll win.,In fact xaynox, assuming u want to play on NA servers,i'll make you the same offer i've made the last 10 people who've 1v1'd me,if you win, I'll give you 100 dollars,ok?,we can play as many games as u want,if you win 1,100 dollars,like i said,1, 10, 100, 1000.,nyy's char is gay,and it's been more than 10 1v1's since then,maylon's god,maylon's klerny,who's also god,i can't imagine,teldo talking this shit,with the way his face looks,<:teldo:272529522673451009>,how is it possible,no,u just need to not look like teldo,LOL,xaynox,look,i'll level with u,i've been aware of the fact ur baiting me this entire time,it's 7 am and there's no for honor,there's nothing else to do,except engage you,because it's funny and fun,and i don't mind the idea of 1v1ing you to prove im better,for the last time,shut the fuck up,stop,talking,😃,o eoekas is eygrr aka ayegrrrr,aka chessmaster69,aka zab's dad,?,one time i talked to eygrr,i don't remember anything about it,which is a better experience than i have with most people in the BR scene,unlikely,idk,i mean honestly i'll probably remember,cus u look like swedish rick ross,and i listen to a good amount of rick ross,then we won't win LAN and eu will claim they're better,true story,oh,apparently there's one,i can't believe it either,inb4 travel expenses outweigh the realistic expenses of participating unless u get 1st,i'll bet,a fat BILLI on it,dont worry,US is in debt 17 tril,i can throw it away,wait, christmas?,i uh,uhhhhhh,how are they expecting the game to survive that long,even me and averse dont expect that,LOL,tbh,i dont even see it making it to f2p,it's like,already rip,with matchmaking changes and players on right now at low-hours,half the servers are dead,like not one match,you're the reason this game will want me to shoot myself on the stupidity and cockiness of this game, You are a good gamer, gaming comes easy to you and thus you shit on games if no one poses a challenge. you are by FAR the most dumbest "pro" gamer i have ever talked to,you're the reason this game will want me to shoot myself on the stupidity and cockiness of this game, You are a good gamer, gaming comes easy to you and thus you shit on games if no one poses a challenge. you are by FAR the most dumbest "pro" gamer i have ever talked to,you're the reason this game will want me to shoot myself on the stupidity and cockiness of this game, You are a good gamer, gaming comes easy to you and thus you shit on games if no one poses a challenge. you are by FAR the most dumbest "pro" gamer i have ever talked to,SLS has sacrificed EVERYTHING to bring you quality content such as the Winter Chest, and my personal favorite, the Halloween Chest.,yeah but like,i hate to say it,like look the reality is,all of us here want BR to be a good game,and want it to succeed,it just isn't good,you can't compare it to overwatch, league, street fighter, paladins, etc for one reason and one reason only,those games are good games.,and BR isn't.,im with joltz,wtf is ruin,dude,im telling u the next big thing is for honor,at least the next big thing that's mechanics focused,it's weird how my mentality has changed lately, but now I don't really care about playing games for the game,I just wanna hold the #1 title and make guap,dont really care what the game is,having that goal makes the game fun even if the game isn't,IE: battlerite,but the world's greatest question remains,how will arakune pay for the flight to the battlerekt LAN,if he never gets paid his 2v2 battlerekt money from november,that they still owe him,🤔,lmao,i intent fed and afked so many games,i guess i shouldn't tell u guys anything,cus that rumor spread quickly, and inaccurately,there's nothing going on with fnatic,we signed with a different team literally yesterday,LOL,to be fair,they really did hit up averse,idk if im allowed to say,ROFL,ya,it was mycon,ya,our whole team did,i mean u know what an NDA is right,i just dont know what all the NDA covers,I mean, I could physically read it off, but I think that breaks the NDA 🤔,point is, i can't talk about the contract,ya,but the org seems pretty legit,and they're the biggest org looking into BR right now,we probably won't gain much, but it's not like we're losing anything opportunity cost wise either,since the game is probably rip,u know,verosk,so funny dude,that SAME THING,happened to me with hotshot,cus i was "noob shifu 1trick who lost to xaynox",hate it when that happens,dyrus <:PogChamp:269924172002492417>,ronklers,pog,,🤔,danny devito as wolverine,i need it,"good

becoming good at for honor with me,like any fighting game, definitely seems more fun to improve with friends,i mean i'll go it alone if i have to,because  im a machine made only to master games and win,even if it's not fun,but i prefer fun,dude i just thought about this for the first time,what if we go to LAN,i don't get stabbed/shot,and we actually just lose,🤔,im a pro battlerite player,TM,apparently,Of course not.,Why would I care?,Like I said, we have nothing to lose anyway, with the current state of the game there's no way a better offer will come along in the near future.,The best case scenario is that the game succeeds and we profit hella from sponsor benefits and shit,worst case scenario is like,exactly as it is now,idk i'll be honest with you, I was pretty 50/50 "eh i dont really see a point in signing, it's sort of whatever",but both of my teammates wanted to,and we're a team,so i went with it,cus whatever,it isn't like that tho,like we're in a legit org,this isn't some "you're our first sponsored team ever and we're an up and coming org" kind of deal,they're just stepping their foot into PC gaming,but in terms of console gaming specifically,it's a HUGE org,like 50+ sponsored players/teams/streamers,nah,actually i guess since we signed the contract im allowed to tell u, there just hasn't been an official announcement yet cause they're working out analytical stuff,but it's Onslaught,if you go "i've never heard of onslaught, wtf is onslaught" like we did, again, it's cause they're 100% console, but a pretty legit org at that,look them up,they're the real deal,o ok,no they're not,<:PogChamp:269924172002492417> G <:PogChamp:269924172002492417>  U <:PogChamp:269924172002492417>   N <:PogChamp:269924172002492417>   N

whatever dude,u get that fat esports money anyway, don't carry money in wallet,ROFL,i mean im not rly worried,but u gotta understand,im from a country,with more guns than people,literally,considering we aren't communists,the amount of killing here is pretty insane,...,but u can get them legally,like,really easily,i could right now,with no training, no safety measures, no background check, no wait period,nothing,LOL,america actually doesn't give a shit,i could buy an assault rifle for like 100 bucks,have it in 3 days,fully loaded,at lan,bazaboy = joltz,oh dude,i picked up csgo,csgo's FIRE,but i suck ass at it,what makes u say that,i've always thought the game was raw as fuck,im just terrible at fps,i think 1.6 is sicker,but it's before my time,i was too YUNG,i feel like csgo would be sick,if i wasnt so bad at it,but im rly bad,what do people want most,tournaments,SOCIAL SYSTEMS,WUT,FACE,reddit DOES IT AGAIN,game feels dead,because you queue into the same guy over and over and over for 4 hours straight,even with 10+ minutes queue times,it was that was even back with the old grades,with 4k players online,lol,getting 8 games in a row with the same 4 players eventually is like,alright,we get it,enough already,HOLY SHIT,THIS RETARD,MADE A YOUTUBE VIDEO,DIRECTED AT ME,SPECIFICALLY,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scUpve_yQPA&feature=youtu.be,WHAHAHAHAHAHAHA,"dude you cant say the game is easy, BECAUSE IT'S HARD! If it wasn't hard, I'd already be a pro!",Actual quote,from the video,ACTUAL,QUOTE,from the video,KEK,of TOP,im laughing so hard,i cant breathe,holy shit rofl,dude you cant say the game is easy, BECAUSE IT'S HARD! If it wasn't hard, I'd already be a pro!,look real talk tho,if u wanna appeal to medium-high skill players and low skill alike, give the game more depth and more outplay options for gameplay variance and replayability,if you ONLY want casuals,give skins, big boobs, and other such shit,sex sells,especially to casual losers,i just dont get how sls manages to please nobody,even themselves,it isnt like they're staying 100% true to their original vision either.,Like, it seems clear to me (and I know many of you disagree) that they're at least TRYING to listen to feedback,they're just really terrible and prioritizing the feedback in terms of what's important and to who,and how important it is,so they do the dumb shit they could do in 2 years now,and dont fix the big gaping issues,and it isn't their fault, they arent players with 500+ hours, they're devs,they dont have pro OR casual player experience, since their staff consists of few if any consistent testers,so when they have to ask reddit or the council and get a billion mixed signals,i mean the answers we want are obvious to us,but i could see how they'd get confused/overwhelmed,fuk u nikita,ur country sucks at chess,1v1 me in an intellectual battle of wits,a 250+ ping shifu mirror,is the only way to settle this,the game needs many things,but it wont get players by fixing 1 or 2 of them,it needs to fix,many,nyy what's up with that?,sounds like a great deal,exploiting government is respectable,in the words of donald trump,"if they can get away with it, my hat's off to them","i couldnt get away with it",,averse having an off day,me and ninjas are the boys though,it's only logical to put them seeded below us since we've never lost a tournament,your logic doesn't make sense..,I'll be damned.,Reddit agress with me,about the problems with BR,https://www.reddit.com/r/BattleRite/comments/5rfjgl/arakune_on_outplay_potential/,I never thought I'd see the day,kms,ty hansa,T O R P E D O G A M I N G,all i do is sleep,i set an alarm for 5 so i'd get up for the tournament,got up to turn alarm off,went back to sleep,woke up 5 minutes before tournament,worth it,there's no juking in that matchup anyway,the round that all 3 of you mongoloided on me and i killed condemned with 10% hp left and ran away,that round i baited 3 trances, 3 of mine got hit, and I landed a triple incap,literally 0 mistakes,u can't juke against a comp like that,it's just hard,it wasn't even just 0 mistakes,every cooldown as burned as optimally as possible,i countered the shifu incap,my incap didn't hit 1 or 2, but all 3,and i still lived with 10% hp,like that's crazy,zzz,look,u guys shouldn't bully klerny so much,he's EASILY within the top 10 lucie players i've beaten this week,EASILY,thanks,idk about u,but i dont think i've lost to 90 different people,even in solo queue,what challenge,we got totally outcomped and still won because me and ninjas stomped,averse couldn't do anything,for the entire game,and we were forced to all in 3 chars with counters,still won,lol,like i said, im the engage against a triple melee triple counter comp,sometimes averse would shoot a rook counter from basically offscreen and I'd die.,You have to actually play at top level to understand,the person who dies isn't exactly always at fault,especially against a comp like that,...,...,outkast,ur a memer,there's a reason averse ditched u to play with us,that's it,you quit because we beat you 5-1 in tournament, because you arrogantly thought you could win tournaments without practicing.,Again, see my first point.,There's a reason averse ditched uou./,you.*,No, you were still entering every single tournament until we stomped you with your own comp,And that was the last tournament either of you entered.,I've played 22 hours in the last 2 weeks on BR,according to BR,i think virtually all of that is tournaments,yet i still win,that was like 3 weeks ago,and i got 500 points in about 5 hours,wasn't that hard,just don't find the game fun,i'll tell you the same thing i tell twitch chat, reddit, and other irrelevant randoms,whether the game has 1000 players, 10000, or 10 million,i don't lose,it makes no difference,it's like saying if i put 10 fish in a tank with a shark, and then 100 fish in a tank with the shark, the shark won't be the apex predator anymore,that's just not how the animal kingdom works,it doesn't matter how many fish are in the pond,a fox and a dog are nearly equivalent,a shark and a small fish aren't,ok, let me use a more apt comparison,if you put god against 100 humans,or against 7 billion humans,god still wins,it's like that,im right here,?,Again, it's simply a hypothetical analogy.,If you compare an omnipotent perfect being to a person, it doesn't matter how many people there are.,we're above all other teams,by a significant margin,but the game is too low skillcap for us to demonstrate it properly,Yeah, because comp matters more than skill,in a game of skill, we would never lose a round.,That's all.,actually,im the strongest player on my team now,after the taya nerfs,Ninjas agrees that im the best,and averse can't beat me anymore,I did watch the vod right after the tournament.,Are you?,I got MVP 7 rounds in a row, including all the ones we lost.,On top of that,My champ gets the least score out of the 3 on the team.,It isn't like that. Averse wasn't questionable, the other comp was made specifically to beat him, so his superior skill is irrelevant, the higher ping is irrelevant. Everything else is irrelevant.,You guys make this more complex than it is.,Klerny,as far as im concerned,u dont have the right to speak to me,i wouldn't team with u either,because i like winning.,same reason outkast can't team with averse,is the reason i won't team with you,you've won more?,I've never lost one game,i say it every day,every week,EU teams are practicing, scrimming, more and more are coming to NA every tournament, there's 2 tournament a week.,We still haven't lost a game.,We don't even practice anymore,nobody on our team plays the game,And we still have yet to lose a single game,You clearly don't understand how large the skill gap is,the ping helps,but it makes little difference,It isn't possible.,"You guys" didn't do anything.,Averse did twice.,I told them to show up.,They didn't.,I'll blame them when they're in the wrong.,I take no responsibility for the idiocy of other people.,We played in tourney last week, on EU.,we got 5th, lost to hotbiscuit/wuzac.,Averse wasn't even there.,No,they're the best team in EU.,I've played them all,several times,the only team that might be better,is corrupted's team,but they're never in anything,No.,Your comp is better.,As I've said, this isn't a game about skill.,Ironically, both your comp you played today and their comp hard counter ours,It's why the matches are close in spite of the ping.,...,You must be joking,How can you make someone feel bad,who can't lose,You've gotta understand the difference between us.,You're a man,I'm a god.,Nothing you say or do will even reach me,because i'm so far above you,we aren't comparable in any way,There's nothing you could possibly say or do that would have any impact in any way.,The only reason I respond by calling you bad is because it's true, and fun.,It's not because I'm angry.,The reality is, I simply won a tournament like I always do, didn't say anything to anyone.,And I find you and outkast here literally in tears about how bad I am,While I never lose.,?,Oh,I misread the context of the situation then.,It's not important enough for me to pay attention,?,It's true.,Do you see how calmly and reasonably I've handled klerny raging at me?,If anything, it's probably because I'm so good now that nothing triggers me anymore.,The words of a loser mean nothing.,Yeah, you're mad because bad.,Hansa, you can't.,Because you can't beat me,^-^,Again, a game that lacks skill.,And I went 50/50 with Nyy.,nyy has yet to take a game off me in tournament.,We did already, averse overslept.,Twice in a row.,Putting responsibility on me because he's a retard is irrelevant.,Believe me,I already threatened to bench him,And raged at him for several hours.,My teammates won't ever leave me, because unlike haters, twitch chat, reddit, random EU scrubs who think im bad, whatever,they know how good I am,That's all it is.,I can say and do anything I want,my skill gives me that privilege,that's why I got sponsored in spite of my attitude,The sponsors literally said "We know arakune's toxic. We don't care.",Because i'm so good,it's irrelevant.,There were no real orgs in blc,I will if my teammates show up,who?,...,who,i've never heard of sk,examples?,i don't watch pro cs or LoL,since i dont play either game,but if that's the case, they're pretty legit,so then the real question is,why were they into BLC,the reality is, none of you know why.,Only the players who quit know why,y'know i dont get either of u,sitting here calling someone who's without doubt much better than both of you trash,i've been competitively gaming a long time,and i've always believed in one solid principle,you can trash talk anyone you want, as long as you can beat them,if you can't beat them, you can't talk trash.,That's all.,I'm saying it's not even just the two of you,nyy, zab, a lot of the EU randoms,they talk shit to me AT THE MOMENT that I win tournaments.,Like, what?,We've beaten NA teams many times.,Iva counters shifu.,This is a game of counterpicking and little skill.,It's the reason you and hotbiscuit's team got close to winning.,Not because you're close to being the same skill.,Ashka/ranid is a counter to every single other comp in the game.,Actually.,It's too easy to mess up, even with 200+ ping.,You'll always hit everything,with 100% consistency.,im pretty consistent in my opinion, but balance ones change from day to day,Yeah, I thought shifu was the best champ in the game against croak for a long time,I still do probably,That said, croak is unbelievably broken.,He doesn't have a true counter.,Shifu is the only one who can go even with him,everyone else loses badly,Our comp "counters" theirs in the sense that it's probably the best comp in the game vs their comp.,Do we win against it? Probably still no.,After all, they're playing the true best comp,^,that depends on where he stealths.,Croak is literally guessing.,If you guess right, you'll probably win.,If you guess wrong, you lose,that's all,And actually a lot of the time even when u guess right,he just leaps over wall,no punish,this is what i mean outkast,ur not good enough to even be discussing this,so just stop discussing it,We've never lost to him either?,?,And im saying,im better than you,my word is law,good talk,"The victors write history",You ever heard that saying?,The point is,As long as nobody is capable of proving me wrong.,I'm right.,We took the only 2 good teams and made them into a team that cannot possibly lose.,I see no problem with that.,the goal of all things is to win,by any means necessary,I was #1 in rocket league, without playing the prior version of the game (Basically their version of BLC) which had been out for 5 years and had many pro players.,The was with the game selling well over 2 million copies.,The amount of fish doesn't matter,Nah, ask current pro players about me.,All of them know how good I was.,Kronovi, low5ive, lots of players i used to play with who i can't remember now,firestarter,zykorune,mattscags,they all said that i was the best player in the game,at the time,im saying you can go to low5ive's stream right now,with his 2000 concurrent viewers,and he'll tell you stories about how i used to demolish him,he's done it a bunch of times,Because I send people to him all the time with that explicit purpose.,The reality is, you can't accept how good I am and you're in denial. You can't possibly fathom the idea that my arrogance isn't actually arrogance, it's overwhelming confidence because I know I can't lose.,You're faced with a mental dilemma, your brain tells you "arakune just sucks and is cocky, he'll never really be a good player",but everything else says the opposite.,There's a term for that,But we crushed you.,Long before we were as good as we are now,The reality is, both ninjas and I have gotten 2-3 times as good as we were back then,and we were better than you then,ninjas and I have become so good,that we don't make mistakes anymore,the reason it was close tonight is because averse was at a friend's house on a new setup, playing against a comp specifically made to destroy him.,So me and ninjas won every single 2v3,2v2,and 1v1,throughout the entire thing,none of us had played at all,for me and ninjas, it was actually our first game of the day,we didnt even bother warming up,because why would we,And this is why my saying is so true,the words of a loser mean nothing.,You can't make a bold statement like "if we practiced, we'd be able to beat you",Then do it.,Or shut up.,because the truth is,if you played 12 hours a day every day,and we continued doing what we're doing,we'd never lose to you,not one time,you aren't even in the tier of players i consider threatening.,You aren't even second rate,you're third or fourth rate,You quit because we were #1. Trying to make it seem like the other way around is hilarious.,I talk to averse about it every day,He knows as well as I do,why you quit.,Almost every day,quite frequently,But we did beat averse.,Once stro quit, we crushed him.,3 weeks in a row.,10-0 in finals,Because comp is everything, skill is irrelevant.,Unlike you, we got games and took them to round 9 many times,in a matchup that is mathematically impossible,I've got a question for you,Why do you hate me so much,Is it because im better than you?,Is that really all it is?,I've never seen such pure hatred from someone,without reason.,And I've earned that right. We beat you fair and square.,In a more than lopsided match.,You could've tried to take the throne back, but you didn't. You quit instead.,And now it's too late.,I said that to averse today. We knew we beat you guys because you were being lazy and cocky and not playing outside tournaments, but he and I both agree that doesn't discredit our win, it's on you for not taking it seriously. A win is a win and we crushed you. If you had taken it seriously and come back the next week, it's possible you would've been able to beat us, even though I genuinely think even back then we were better.,But you never even tried,so how can you sit here and pretend you're better?,<@97835358221250560> btw,averse said he was happy you quit,dunno,of course it doesn't,nothing really matters to us except winning,probably cause it's true,he has a reason,he just probably wouldn't appreciate me telling you it,lol,oh sorry im back,fizz, you're irrelevant and suck,don't come back,you'll live your life?,your life that consists of sitting in a discord with players who don't know who you are and don't like you,crying about a game you quit because you were shit at it?,you'll "live your life?",i'll never get people like you,find something better to do with your time,it's not the place for you,clearly your skin is too thin to take any criticism,Do you understand how annoying it is for me and averse to constantly be undermined despite everything we do,despite proving countless times that we're good,but one guy you look up to tells you you're bad at the game,and rather than taking it in stride, or getting mad and becoming motivated,you quit the game,and talk about how dead it is,The reality is,we've been quietly playing our game for MONTHS,but reddit, twitch chat, discord, are all EU circlejerks since that's where 80% of the remaining playerbase is,that just never shut up about how bad we are,despite how good we are,outkast don't say another bad word about my mother you miserable grimeball fuck,^_^,^_^,i only game with people who have talent,sorry,In the same way that me telling fizz he's bad isn't toxic, and in the same way that me saying im better than you and sketch isn't toxic, it isn't rude.,Being blunt and stating facts, not opinion, isn't rude or toxic.,It's just blunt.,Truth hurts.,I'm the best player on the best team on earth.,I've said it countless times dude,finding excuses for why im the best doesn't change the fact that im the best,and the reality is, i've disproven those opinions in other games,Sitting here in an endless state of denial coming up with an infinite amount of implausible reasons why im the best does nothing but make you look silly.,I'm the best because I'm the best,it's as simple as that,Well, at least for the next 6 months, we'll remain #1.,As long as I'm contractually obligated to be the best in the world, I will.,And then I'll probably get bored and quit.,I enjoy competing and winning against people of similar skill,onesidedly smashing everyone isn't as fun as it sounds.,Nobody, that's my point.,There's nobody with similar skill.,The only people who are close are on my team,If there's a LAN tourney, I'll bet all my money on myself.,If there's an incentive to win, I'll win,even if there isn't, I'll probably win,it's just how i am,I care about money less than having fun.,That's why I quit league, rocket league, and a couple other games I could've made money off of.,Just do me a solid,don't talk shit about us until we lose,it's just common sense.,My teammates and I all agreed I played amazingly.,Some of the best play i've ever had in tournament, as a matter of fact.,I mightaswell have beaten them by myself.,The rounds I died first and the rounds we lost were my fault literally one time.,Out of a 2 game tournament,with like 19 rounds.,Ninjas capitalizes on opportunities I create, that's always been our style, even in 2v2.,I was crushing everyone so badly 1v1, 1v2, and 2v1, that ninjas job was easy,that's what shifu does.,He did everything right, i agree,but he had a couple rounds he blew counters and died for no reason,averse had several times he didn't get 3 stacks and just got mongo'd,I almost inarguably played better than both of my teammates, and it's not like im blaming them for that,But even while playing that well,im also the shotcaller,I call all our rotations, I call who to focus, I call every CD,I do everything,and outplay them at the same time,It's something you'd have to play with me to understand,I make every player on my team better,That's because ninjas' shifu is a slightly worse version of mine, it's extremely good.,That said, even ninjas randomly asked me two days ago "How is your shifu so fucking good",im on another level,When I was replaced with condemned, my team lost to a team we've 10-0'd half a dozen times,It's not like im the entire team,but it really comes together with me,im the reason we don't lose,I'll always wonder how people can be so blind in the face of overwhelming evidence.,HAHAHAHAHAHA,,FOR,FUCKING,HONOR,WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO,joltz,are u mentally and physically prepared,for the fucking grind,i was born ready,you'd be hard pressed to find

right,i love how fierce everyone is,rip trolldracii,I'll be the best in the world at that game,i can't remember the last time I had so much fun,i felt the same way about BR,and even 500 hours into BR i was still losing and getting angry,but like i said, i give it 200% always,i dont care if it takes 10000 hours,gotta be 1st,<@150933458414206976> have u watched hajime no ippo?,^,agreed,L A L L A P A L O O Z A,wait,WHAT,ARE YOU KIDDING ME,5 points for a win, 14 for a loss, 16-26 or so,for a high rating difference win,It's pretty easy,65%~ winrate to move up,assuming that's consistent,and u dont lose to players worse than you,joltz,u never reply,eurocuck,o,ok then,I know the feeling.,Well, not that much,that's some edgy shit,even for me,MADNESS,IMPRISONING ME,ALL THAT I SEE,EVERY MEME,,teldo quitting is expected,and reversible,im fully convinced teldo is what kills games,dyrus is based,have u ever heard him speak,he's literally a sloth,in human form,all i do,is watch dyrus get mad at reginald,and reginald actually tells dyrus he's his bitch,and dyrus gets mad back at him,and regi is like,"this guy could actually kill me","perhaps i should reconsider",and just leaves him alone,it's so good,i love how dyrus is just sitting here streaming silently, playing the game,not saying anything to anyone,and reginald calls him "fucking bad" LOUD AF right next to him, in a conversation with another person,over,and over,and over,and over,and over,dyrus as nicely as he can,"shut up dude, just shut up",reginald with the,"what?","what'd you say?","dude im not even talking to you","you got a problem",dyrus so close,to committing murder on stream,it's the best clip,he literally just like,keeps egging him on,over and over and over,dude if my teammates were like that,i would,r e t i r e,"wait why did you tell us to shut up","wait why did you tell us to shut up","wait why did you tell us to shut up","You guys are just so loud","So what","You're so fucking rude dude","why don't you shut up",the best part is that after all this,dyrus is like,"okay, im sorry for being rude.",even though he's not at fault AT ALL,regi's like "dude why are you so rude","you're acting like a fucking brat",like,guy just cannot drop it,even though he's so far in the wrong,and then finally dyrus starts yelling at him,but it's like,after all that,i dont' think he could've handled it any better,honestly speaking,like i would've killed him,how is he so patient,did u know joltz hates me,because he wishes for worldwide communism,H-H-H-H-HERE WE GO

D,STUNNING,HD,so was I,I used to watch shadows on the wall,turn into full figures,like, shadow people,and then they'd walk up to me,and get like,probably half an inch away from my face,and just sit there,for hours,but they moved SUPER slowly,it took them minutes to move across my room,and i'd just stare at them,cus they basically had the like,slenderman game mechanic,where if i didn't look directly at the shadow people,thing,they'd move WAY faster,like, within a second or two they'd be right on top of me,if i looked one way then looked back,There's probably some deep psychological meaning behind it,but all it said to me,was "be a god of gaming",so i did that,ya sleep paralysis is weird,sometimes ur just god and can control everything and ur self aware,sometimes ur just locked

especially as a streamer
probably never gonna join an org,doom3132 is like,such a fitting name,why is it EVERY guy like that,who just spams u about how bad u are or what a dick u are or whatever,they're always like "TwitchStreamMonster58382382734829","edgelord69420carlsaganswag","nikita_fan_2001",and ur like,"dude fuck off",dude when i used to see europeans on the NA lol servers and they'd type like that guy,i was always like "there's no way these guys are this stupid, english just isn't their first language",but now as i delve into games with like multi-regional communities,europeans are actually,SO fucking stupid,like 20 times dumber than the average NA memer/rager/player,which is insane,because the NA people are really stupid too,the EU randoms are like,so dumb you almost wonder if they're even sentient,like if they're even real people,like, with no mental disability,u almost can't believe like,that they're just normal guys raging over a computer,like everyone else,like something actually seems wrong with them,on a mental level,every time,man,the eoekas vs finlev thread,eoekas points out katie is lying,naturally nobody believes him,finlev INSTANTLY comes to the rescue,to whiteknight for katie and sls,like the HERO he is,HERO,the PROFESSIONAL STREAMER PRO PLAYER BLC VETERAN SPONSORED BY CLG HERO,FINLEV™,i hate how fake his whole image is so much,lol,finlev is a donkey,eoekas is in a chess club,enough said,>beans in tomato sauce,excuse,me,im italian,and what the fuck is this,you have two or 3 eggs,some toast, some sausage maybe,smoe bacon,tall glass of ORANGE JUICE™,maybe like,a bagel with some cream cheese,hashbrowns,what the fuck is BEANS IN TOMATO SAUCE,HELLO,HM,typical breakfast here is like,oatmeal,or some combination of 2-3 of the things i listed,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7p9DME9Y6pM,yanger,Y A N G E R,where's zab when u need him,🔥,beat is so raw,it's a smoke sesh yanger imo,3 days until for honor,🔥 🔥,💯,im not big on katt,especially since he got his ass beat by a 14 year old he punched first,<:thunking:269957648395403274>,he has it coming honestly,dude's a dick,it's like if i stood against the government or something,i'd get hella backlash cus im an asshole,not cus im wrong,lol,idk,he is an asshole tho,swag,ya i don't like,hate the guy,or something,just not a fan,i've seen a good amount of his standup,it's pretty hit or miss,50k lan is like,my sponsor better get me a fuckin chair,that's all im sayin,well anyway, SLS already announced the LAN to me,not that it matters,it's regionlocked,so we win no matter what,legit af chairs,yo averse,honest question,are u nervous at all? with battlerekt being cancelled it's gonna have been a week since we've played,on wednesday,i feel like i don't even remember anything about battlerite,im not,can't stand the idea,realistically,i probably won't practice again until we lose,but you'll prolly see my performance drop way off,the last couple tournaments i've been the one carrying for once,and it's never been that way,it's always been u or ninjas,im not bout it,so u guys can go back to carrying,averse,nah he's playing osu,aka destroying his own hands,ya but u were shit last week too honestly,ninjas hasn't really gotten worse overall like u, but he does have those rare rounds where he makes 1 mistake and dies without doing anything, that's just how sirius is,im the only one out of the 3 of us that's gotten better in the last couple months,but ima go back to being worse again,i dont like carrying,too much pressure for the same result,<@150306355725598720> i dont disagree,but the point is, i did, a lot,and now i can't anymore,and both of them have fallen off a bit,so ima take a break,rekt,u really were,but honestly,someone had to stop u,no one man should have all that power,it's like if orochi had peacekeeper's grab,not like this,klerny,what're u referencing,there's no reason to get a big org involved anyway honestly,until our contract is up, it's pointless,they won't want anyone except us,¯\_(ツ)_/¯,look, in my defense,i was against it,both averse AND ninjas wanted to,we negotiated with them and it's very VERY low commitment,tbh the biggest thing i lose,is not being able to change our team name to "pay me my fucking money NGE",cus now i have a team name,are u making up orgs,who cares,I can't really talk about our contract because there's an NDA, but if an offer from a better org came along we have virtually no commitment to onslaught.,It's something I personally discussed with them,we're 0 risk,To be fair, their intentions really do seem good.,That said, we benefit them more than they benefit us.,We're aware of that.,Who cares?,im just ripping out of the ol' triple honeycomb perc dude,ur too fancy for me zab,LOL,battlerite's official twitter,tweeted about our sponsorship,10 minutes ago,<:LUL:269941798107873286>,they don't take any money from us,tho,As I said, we benefit them more than they benefit us.,But don't get the wrong idea,we aren't affected in ANY way,negatively,If being with them was worse than not being with them, I would've refused. Obviously.,Everyone knows all I care about is money.,It's irrelevant because of one of the clauses in the contract, not that i can talk about it.,Even if we signed for 10 years it would make no difference,if the scene actually blows up,cus of the way the contract is,i made sure it was that way,in this hypothetical scenario that someone needs to pay us out, there's no chance we get cucked,trust,just take my word for it klerny, i read the entire contract myself twice,there's nothing fishy in there,it's just how it seems, we don't benefit much from being with them, but we don't lose anything, and they benefit massively from having us which in turn should incentivize them to help us as much as they can since they want us to resign once the short contract is up.,ya,it's been run by multiple people,he just had warden read it 3 times, then he was like "yep it's fine" so i get fucked,it was all part of his 27 step plan,ofc,i wouldn't trust warden to make a bowl of cereal,well, this is the fam discord,we love everyone in this discord,at least i do,LUL,AHAHAHHAHA,oh man,the joltz roast,into the zab counterroast,it's so good,blankkz has the right idea,even if they give us NOTHING, it's a neutral exchange,no better offer will come up that the contract doesn't account for in the near future,so it doesn't matter,actually the singularity is gonna be reached in like 30 years,and then i'll live forever,LATA BITCH,nah im with joltz,people are always like "leave behind a legacy for your family" maybe my opinions will change if i have a kid or something,i've never cared about ANYTHING less,im gonna be dead,wtf do i care,gamble it ALL,A L L,humanity's future,good or bad,won't have me in it,so idgaf,ya,i'll get right on that,i'll hit you up when i find a girl i give a fuck about,approximately never,20,joltz should impregnate my mother and move to my house so we can be the best 2v2 for honor team in NA,nah,6 years is way underestimating,realistically, i don't think i'll ever be the type to stay with a chick,it's just not who i am,Unlikely.,My thinking hasn't changed at all in the last 6 years,and normally it changes DRASTICALLY from 14-20,i'm pretty unusually stubborn,ya that's fine,im cool living on my own, working, whatever,i don't care about chicks at all tho,i won't ever,the only way i've changed in the last 6 years,is that im a way less shitty person now,o that's fine,i was 10 billion times worse as a teenager,like socio level bad,like, im still not that great of a dude now,but u didn't wanna know 16 year old arakune,nah dude it was more just like,I was in highschool surrounded by people I hated except for my best friend, who was also my drug dealer,and i was a minor, so laws didn't affect me and I knew I could do whatever I wanted,well i didnt go to school,every day i walked 3 minutes to my best friend's house,and we just did hard drugs and got drunk,24/7,in his cockroach infested grandparent's house,it was dope,it was a dope time,it was great,i miss that guy,he got arrested and i never got to speak to him again,he probably shouldn't have committed like,30 felonies,experiences like that build character,it's the kind of thing everyone should go through at some point,i have more character then i did beforehand,:^),hence,u didn't wanna know 16 year old arakune,i was a lit nutcase,ROFL,i remember that story,rip rifle,honestly rifle's experience was 10 billion times worse than mine,even though mine sounds terrible, it was actually a great time,i don't recall ever having more fun than i did in HS,banging a chick and getting her pregnant,is the LEAST fun,that's a grave error you cannot recover from,M I N I T O W N,when are u gonna teach minitown,how to play basketball,ball is life,if u raise him from small child,he can be LEGEND,😠,minitown doesn't ball,even tho ball is life,feelsbadman,to be fair,is ur gf THAT unlikable,like, sure u can fake it,but she was hot enough that u nailed her and her personality can't be THAT dogshit,????,sounds like a very similar situation to my mother and her boyfriend,he hates everything about her,and she knows he hates it,so she gets mad at him,which makes him hate everything more,perpetual feedback loop,perhaps if you were better at faking it, she wouldn't ride your ass about everything rifle,you probably just suck at faking it,and she can tell,and is mad,lol,probably because she's looking for proof of one of two things,1. you hating her, which she knows you do,2. you cheating on her, which she assumes you are, since she knows you hate her,this really isn't that complex of a situation,Just be better at faking it.,no rifle,she's afraid you're going to cheat because she can tell you hate her,where is the common sense,that's also why she's limiting everything you say and do so much,be better at faking it,take acting lessons,well,im a socio,i see through people,S O C I O E C O N O M I C S,eoekas,1v1 me socioeconomics,rifle,wait wait wait,so how did this cycle begin,u hate her, she sees it and acts like a total bitch, which makes u hate her,which came first, the chicken or the egg,EVERYTHING,unfortunately, self-preservation is a basic human instinct.,If he'd be suicidal with her, staying with her even for the benefit of his kid isn't plausible,you're better off meeting somewhere in the middle, which is what you're doing.,he loves himself more than his daughter. Probably.,Almost all humans do,Yeah actually a split household with 2 loving happy parents is better than a dysfunctional one with both,especially one that will split eventually anyway,it's not like they'll end up working out,ITT: BLC veterans teach parenting to idiot who forgot to wear a condom,nyy that's a great point actually,kids aren't dumb enough to not notice people faking it,even without huge fights, when your parents seem "fake" you can tell it's off,it just doesn't seem right,rifle,you should've gone,"did u know i used to be black",gross,dude if i had to choose between living with a bitch i absolutely despised and listening to her cry at me 24/7,or playing battlerite,i'd choose the first option,agree,not agree,im just content to never be interested in anyone,it comes with the socio package,rifle's just selfish and doesn't want to sacrifice anything in his current lifestyle to satisfy his gf,i'd do the same thing,ur a legend rifle,well, i'm sure you'd be willing to sacrifice some,she's just asking too much of u,in ur opinion,i think if i ever had a kid i might dip,im not sure,it's not so much about hating the idea of parenting, or wanting to be with different chicks or something,it's just that i'd rather have nobody,like, if i had to choose between having a girlfriend 24/7 or nobody, i'd choose nobody,for sure,even if she was the best girlfriend,joltz,how do u play BR,<:LUL:269941798107873286>,we're better anyway,these retards are my family too,honestly rifle, ur probably the person here who's most like me.,Most people don't think that's a good thing,so u should really think on it,Well I appreciate it.,That said, you should stop being a fag and sarcifice what's important to you for the wellbeing of your child and ultimately yourself.,You'll probably be happier in the long run,without that cunt all over you 24/7,for breathing wrong,The point is you shouldn't be able to make the argument that you're spreading yourself too thin or that you don't have the energy to be both a good boyfriend and a good father,not that I ever would, but if I had a kid, I'd give 300% all the time.,You don't really have room to make excuses or be lazy,Then you're doing what you can I suppose.,im sure u dont want to cus u hate her,but have you considered just like,talking to her,about the gayass doublestandards,im sure she wouldn't hear it anyway,because she thinks you're a cheater and hate her and all this,Honestly, you've sort of backed yourself into a corner.,uhhhhhhh,well context is important,what is the shitstorm about,is it just about you leaving?,or did she want you to be around,zzzzzz,see but like,that's half your fault from your past,and half your fault again cus she hates u,you've fucked yourself here,i know that,im just saying,be understanding to her situation,idk,i just feel like in a situation like that,you've gotta pick your battles,and going out with your friends for your birthday,is definitely a battle you take,NEED,look getting off the subject of rifletown for a sec and back to SLS,i love that the first thing in the blogh,and something they spend 3 paragraphs on,is the mount,Like, the thing about the GC mount,is that in a NORMAL GAME, it's barely worth mentioning,but since everyone has GC,and they know that,they talk about it,rofl,Arakune - Today at 11:54 AM,Arakune - Today at 11:54 AM,Arakune - Today at 11:54 AM,no,*raises hand* i know what it is,helo,do u want me to be extremely specific?,u guys are fam,so im HOPING u fucks dont tell them,uh,same,LOL,nah,it's regionlocked,we win no matter what,<:LUL:269941798107873286>,i was like "hey sls can you give me the payout percentages for the different placings?

delusional nigger,Averse - Today at 5:50 PM
delusional nigger,send it to his sponsor dude,hold on,i'll talk to averse,zzz,averse what do u not understand,people in this discord,are fam,f a m,the non-fam already left the discord for the most part,i trust u equally as much as averse,which is to say i'd tell u p much anything,kek,cus he's my teammate,i can trust averse because i can bench averse,great how that works,i wouldn't bench averse cus he's a homie and a good friend,but the point stands that i could,and me and ninjas would whop whoever he found,taboo?,wtf is taboo?,do i watch it?,wait wait,wait,wtf,is it,dude i've missed EVERY good tv series of the last 4 years,breaking bad, dexter, orange new black, etc etc,all of them,is it actually worth watching,i will watch,dude dexter is 🔥,from what i've heard,o word,ok then,wow,averse sooooooooooo mad at me,blowing up my pms,top 10 anime deaths,ya,if only i wasn't such a monster,u could get rid of me,o please,i cleared with my sponsor already,what im allowed to talk about,Btw I really like people bringing up grimgoon's name 69 times without me mentioning him,i see the subtle memeing,that's the kind of shit i love about this discord,<@105221541024772096> yo.,we should scrim the EU teams,more like see if we lose any rounds,our full team doesn't lose,besides, i need warmup,haven't played much at all,we got hard countered,and then me and ninjas won 2v3,so what,ya averse was so useless,didn't do anything,that said, he was also at a friend's house,so he can use that excuse,or he can use the rook/sirius/shifu against jumong argument,both are valid,jumong is bad vs anyone in the game without 3 stacks,especially rushdown,that's the most rushdown comp in the game,turtle meta was a thing actually,in NA 2v2,for like 3 months,oldur/jumong,unbeatable,nowadays it probably loses to lucie/shifu,u think nikita?,we have like garbo champ variety in NA,so it's hard to say,eoekasasasasasasas,averse,STILL raging at me,holy god,send help,thats what im saying,entire chat is spamming about grimgoon when i dont mention him,averse acts like i leaked everything,zzzz,EU leaked,i got it from them,:^),grimgoon is actually secretly the mount that will be released for GC,it's him IRL,the prototype in the blogpost is a bait and switch,#leaked,zzzz,why dont i bench this guy,u realize we can win without you, right.,you have no impact on the outcome of our matches,ur on the team cus it makes sense and we're homies,but u cry about everything,just stop crying already,ur hurting my brain,As I said.,And i told averse that and he's like,"no they didn't, they had no idea",grim literally mentioned that they knew to averse in our convo with him,down syndrome,zzzzzz,averse such a problem starter,swear to god,dude i hate "hamburger flavored" pizza the other day,it was SO bad,it was death,joltz,im most relevant,ur only relevant cus we're friends,"salade",excuse me,same,that said,ur gonna prove urself,in for honor,when i give u that work,im gonna play zerker,and hump the air at u,and u will stand no chance,joltz,did u see,i finally was getting decent at it,yoooo, for real,<@105221541024772096> be our 4th,let's win it,god team,actually,ninjas plays too,but he's noob,i beat ninjas worse than i beat communism,by the very last day of the closed beta,i was smashing everyone,at least like, everyone in our circle that played,joltz was the hardest,averse was the hardest every day except the last one,i had that download,i use controller, everyone else uses mouse afaik,u should def use controller if u have it,ya i actually dont have a 360 controller, I have some third party dogshit controller,and whe I block left/right it blocks top SO much,it's so annoying,can't tell if it's me or controller tho,same way on controller,u know i think the thing that feels weird,is that to block left you go STRAIGHT left, right is STRAIGHT right, but irl and even in the game's animations it looks like you wanna block top left most of the time or top right,the animations don't match the inputs,there's a disconnect there,and so sometimes you block top left or top right and it just registers as top,shit sucks,ya imo it's much easier to quickly move the stick (or mouse) straight up than it is straight left or right,they should make the input window larger,KEK,<@161237820713861121>,i mean like i said, even with a controller that's true,you have a tendancy to go slightly up or down,but you'll never go slightly down in for honor,so it should give you more

dishonorable retards,comeback mechanics in fighting games are good,for that exact scenario,u can outplay and kill them,it's swag,why would i win with my teammate,if i could just,win myself,i literally had to do that in the brite tourney yesterday,down 0-4 in the first game,i killed 1 in a 2v3,then my teammate died,killed both of the remaining 2 1v2,and we reverse swept them,i got mvp 4 rounds in a row,from 0-4 to 5-4,easy game,easy life,joltz lol,that picture,i hope you're ready to get whooped,nyy suck <:joltzieMegu:278933977773899786>,joltz u can't say that, he's team captain according to SLS studios TM,he'll BENCH you,BENCH,: (,to be fair,nobody searches for scrims,the less i play battlerite,the better i am at the game,the longer of a break i go on,the harder i rape in tournaments,i beat every team by myself practically now,even tho my teammates are getting rustier,makes no difference,carry so hard,A R A K U N E,xaynox nah it isn't like that,the less i play, the better i get,besides, i 5-0'd your freya on NA ping,and then I beat it on EU ping,you're worth less than the dirt i walk on,?,no that guy sucked,im thinking of xaynox,or wait,was xaynox the shifu mirror?,o ya i remember,u still got raped,swag,see it's hard for me to keep track cus like,i 1v1 so many different people,and i beat all of them,so everyone kind of blurs together,well,for honor isn't out for another hour,i've got time,let's go,it's like i said,taking a break has actually done me a lot of good,i don't rly make mistakes now,last tournament was bar none the highest level play i've seen from anybody,i actually raped,like,i got mvp 7 rounds in a row, including when my teammates lost,every round we lost was averse or ninjas getting caught and instakilled because croak/oldur/ashka is 0 skill autism,and i would 1v2 or 1v3,and live for 100 years,and hit literally everything,made so few mistakes,it was actually disgusting,me and averse talked about my mindset,it's good for our team,u need someone overwhelmingly confident and cocky, because ninjas and averse are both kind of insecure,like, they've told me this,my confidence is why we never lose,even when we're getting raped,im certain we'll win,and then we do,i mean yesterday we were legit down 0-4 in the first game,and i was just like "man, im never gonna hear the end of this one if we get 5-0'd on NA ping by EU",so then i decided to win by myself,and did,averse turned up too,i think deep down,neither of us can stand losing,like, if u really push us to the point where we might lose,you'll see how good we actually are,it's miles above everyone else,lol,it's the truth,if there's ever a lan i'll show u,the difference between me and averse and anyone else,is immense,even if we both stopped playing for months,nobody would catch up,that much im certain of,gods playing against mortals,we won without losing a game,but me and averse had to try our hardest for the first time,it was jank,https://www.twitch.tv/videos/120695502,2:30:30,is timestamp,cus i had nothing else up,and it heals,duh,do u know what my most recently perma'd account in league was named?,"Best Trynd World",I don't care about NA or EU,im better than everyone else at everything.,That's how it is.,Region doesn't matter,the only reason u dont see anything amazing from the US,is because i don't try at many games,the thing about regional pride is that it's baseless,it's always a couple of people that carry their entire country,i could do it easily,im good enough to put NA at the top of the map in any game,wherever i am is the best region by default,oh btw the whole "NA is never good at anything" meme thing,USA has won OWC 2 years in a row now,and osu is the hardest game ever made by a ton,it's so hard that to be as good as me you almost always sustain permanent injury,and im not even close to the top,lol,how is it irrelevant?,the game has 2 million players,it's the biggest rhythm game of all time,and it's had a yearly world cup featuring over 80 countries,for 10 years,I can understand ur perspective in that sense,but what u dont get is i don't disagree with u,it's not about which region is better,the only thing that matters is where the best players are,and me and averse are in NA,so we're the strongest region,that's all,it doesn't matter if it's 1 team against 10 teams because you have a deeper pool of good players,we could beat everyone by ourselves,we don't need "our region",because i've yet to ever be impressed by a single european player,but im impressed by myself and averse all the time,we're simply better,it isn't subjective,i've said it before, good players can tell just by looking at other players how good they are,I can tell you're worse.,My backing for my claims is that I've watched you play,that's all,lol,nyy,stop  cry,you suck,your country sucks,me > you,successful at exterminating a religion,that's about it,USA shut down germany in 0.3 seconds,just like i would to EU at lan,the crowd would be silent, the other team would be silent,you'd just be stuck there,eating your words,when u see how good i am,lol,i know i will,for a while i thought about whether or not we could lose at LAN,but im certain now,we can't,realistically, no matter what changes the game goes through,i don't think we'll lose one tournament until someone on our team quits the game,haha,xd,<:thunking:269957648395403274>,joltz,are u gonna main warden or did u only play it cus it's like the most all around generic class,like are u gonna try to specialize this time around?,im prolly gonna play zerker and kenshi,zerker seems SO fun,you just hump the air,and scream at people,We NA are outnumbered,Each one of our players must be a match for 10 EU opponents,one Arakune is a match for 100,wait so like, real talk for a second joltz,how did u guys lose round 1?,like we saw the guys you lost to,and were like "what",and you've lost to kebab on NA too a couple times,is the ping that hard for u guys?,wat.,nikita why,ROFL,in what game,for honor or br,uh,croak + any ranged dps + anything else,me and averse are convinced in 3v3 croak is the strongest champ in the game,he's SO broken,every time he incaps someone they die,and ur stuck making 50/50's constantly,he's so fucking gay,well wuzac is the best croak player by a lot,but his teammates both suck,so it's whatever,and wuzac is the best player of the best character,so he's like,almost comparable to me and averse,just cus of game balance,joltz,u must hold in ur rage,and unleash it,in for honor,press 1 if u feel bad for him,press 1,there was an ESL tourney yesterday?,how'd that go,didn't catch it,it was the same situation for us,me and averse got so mad,played so insane,for 5 straight rounds,we crushed them the 2nd game too,like,as soon as me and averse woke up,we just played like gods,for 12 straight rounds,joltz,liver blow,L I V E R B L O W,G  A  Z  E  L  L  E,ya, the entire patch was leaked to me already.,If shifu's nerfed I'll main the new char,he'll be good in our comp,I don't know the details of the shifu rework,just some balance tweaks,and all the new char stuff,jumong op again?,another day in paradise,C O U N C I L T O W N,ya reaver should be pretty sick,i might play him some,but i'll probably be too into for honor,to care,,: (,nyy,real talk,i can run through his entire kit for u,if u have any questions,his Q doesn't deflect 5 attacks,it deflects infinite.,It's like an AOE bakko shield,but worse,because it deflects them 180 degrees back,not at the person,so if you sidestep it won't hit,but it makes him virtually invincible,no,ur country is irrelevant,and ur mom,lol,rekt,xd,,,M E A T Y,nyy,enter ur own butthole,dude,yo i wanted to get EU's opinion on this,we all agree hotbiscuit sucks ass right,just so we're on the same page,<:thunking:269957648395403274>,wait srsly,he's terribad,cus we've played against him a lot,and i think he sucks,his char is the same on 200 ping as it is on 0,he waits for croak incap, presses Q, pressed m2,wow, stunning gameplay,ashka main,wow,doesn't work that way,cus shifu can mess up his space or Q,ashka can't mess up Q > M2,Because they're STANDING IN PLACE,INCAPPED,lol,nyy ur wrong,certified retard,wuzac is the best player in EU,ur the ones who don't know shit,hotbiscuit sucks,i didn't drop out to be a LoL pro,i just dropped

Fixed an issue where, sometimes, Open NAT players would not be able to be matchmake at all; this happened on every game mode but more importantly on Duel and Brawl.,PogChamp,I can PLAY THE GAME AGAIN,HOORAY,<@208693717563998209> sure.,i just learned my class has 2 moves i never use,im level 50,🤔,America? <:PogChamp:269924172002492417>,is he ok?,why'd he get detained,did he snap after someone said he was carried by ninjas,well,why was he denied citizenship,are they super strict or something?,...,so if he said that,why wouldnt he be ok back in china,y'know besides like,communism,but ur friend seems cool with idea of china,prolly doesn't seem as cool once they're actually like "ok, go there",nty,o,well you said he said he'd be fine there,so he seemed chill,oooooooo,i misread, i thought HE said that,and they were just like "ok, fuck off",i mean i didn't literally ask for the guy's life story,but sounds like there's like a 100% chance he gets citizenship,given his scenario,prolly not worth worrying about,also, when's for honor.,ok,i mean it's like 10,you're lookin at brunch here soon,FUCK YOU RIFLE,YOU'RE NOT MY REAL DAD,ya most people work 5 days a week,just cus u work weekends,who gives a shit,fuck off u fag,everyone else > u,including me,morning joltz,for honor?,also,are u entering 2v2 tourney today?,😦,OwO,gl,god,100%,never miss,i deflect now too,?,oh,im playing 2's with verosk,if u want to get destroyed,i will after this match.,implying u have anything to do,our match is JUST starting,so might be better to wait till later,1 more round,then we play,joltz,u wanna play?,<@150933458414206976>,ya honestly,everything i read except that one line was good news and positive stuff,and it's still bad news overall,lol,giv money,double elim + 2nd getting almost as much as 1st means no matter what im cashing out,it's a payday,Klerny, grim told us already,apparently he said you guys had asked because you were worried about us doing the same,dont be scared homie,im tryna make that cheddar,on your expense,klerny you have a history,of taking my spear up your ass,what are u talking about,both teammates suck ass, averse not even home,5-4,i 2v2 or 2v3 3 different rounds,mvp 70% of rounds,ur putting me to sleep,can't do battlerekt in an hour,i have for honor tournament,gotta see how good i am,https://battlefy.com/for-honor,https://battlefy.com/for-honor,v,https://battlefy.com/for-honorhttps://battlefy.com/for-honor,https://battlefy.com/for-honor,https://battlefy.com/for-honor,https://battlefy.com/for-honor,https://battlefy.com/for-honor,https://battlefy.com/for-honor,https://battlefy.com/for-honor,https://battlefy.com/for-honor,https://battlefy.com/for-honor,?,i,am,god,me = god,except with a larger cock,and more money,i'd fuck u up in anything,who bitch this is,do u know who the fuck i am,im a guy,on the internet,getting in an argument,aka a L E G E N D,damo,we aren't expecting to get first,if we get far enough into bracket that i have to leave for the BR tournament,that's fine,like this is our first tourney ever,and my winrate is 70%,zyko's is like 93%,but we aren't the best players we've played,we lose to pubs occasionally,so,not expecting us to make it 4 hours deep in tourney,337,but that's across all platforms,it's about 130 for PC iirc,prize money is like 300 bucks for first LOL,it's just for fun,wanna see how we do,it's all crowdfunded too,<:PogChamp:269924172002492417> //,Yo can u guys do me a super duper soliderino,and help me convince SLS staff,that the players in the tournament would prefer more top-heavy prize distribution,as is standard,like a 1st-3rd 60/30/10 standard payout,instead of this like, 30/25/20/69 cancer,they're doing,where everyone wins,I already sent a big wall of friendly esports text grimgoon's way,im hoping we can convince them,no way 4th should get paid in an 8 man invitational,and no way 3rd should be making a grand, likely only having to beat one good team,in either EU or NA,pretty ridiculous imo,3000 for first is exactly 60%,Aka the international standard for big tournaments.,2nd gets 1500, 3rd gets 500.,That's the best way,klerny it's the international standard for big tournaments. I'm not saying this is also a big tournament,why do u have to be so stupid all the time,i agree,that said, if ur a top 20 melee player in the world and u go to ur weekly local and win 110 dollars,nobody's gonna say you dont deserve the money,there's just no competition and you're much better,the payouts are still the same,whether a god shows up to the tourney or not,they can't "force" more competition into the NA scene with these jank payouts,the outcome will be the same no matter what,cus it's the community,not the incentive,that's lacking,u know,summit got well over 60k viewers for ssbm,i think it broke 100k at one point,that said ssbm is the 2nd biggest fighting game in history,so,made it to round 5 of for honor tournament,our opponents said we didn't show up when we did,we got DQ'd falsely,i told an admin and he said "you guys prolly wouldn't have stood a chance anyway, whatever dude",so naturally,i called him a nigger at least 30 times,then i got banned for toxicity,worth,the for honor tourney,our opponent legit was just like "yeah they didn't show",without trying to contact us,i tell admin and he's like,"well they already moved up in brackets","u prolly would've lost anyway",and i went,and then they weren't happy,1. reddit,2. he was clearly like 14,3. meme,zykorune,he was my 2v2 partner when i was #1 rocket league player in world,also a top 2000 osu player and ssbm guy who lives like 40 minutes from me,super coincidence,met him online in RL,shifu's pretty bad,but like,it's still shifu,i mean comp synergy wise,can't get much worse,but all 3 of them are strong champs still,polo/varesh synergy is fine,1-4 months after release,IE: up until i quit,i quit at rank 1,,no nyy,it means best,arakune/10,and at the top i sit,with my 85% winrate,average 5 goals a game,wrong,played every EU player,and raped them,on EU ping,it's called,skill,u should grow some,FUCKING HITLER!,!,Owo,oWo,owO,black :wutface:,ROFL,and the president,something something topical,political,meme,hi trump <:joltzieW:268031910498795520> / big fan,look how white and square that face is,trump loves it too,averse,ur better than me at osu,give tips,more like,project GAYrizon,WOOOOOOOOOOOO,joltz let me tell u something,my father told me,OwO,OwO,OwO,New World Memer?,did u hear trump was on the phone with putain like, 2 days ago,and told him "the nuclear missle treaty we have is awful","it benefits russia","i dont like it",<:PogChamp:269924172002492417>,trump trying to kill us all <:PogChamp:269924172002492417>,mycon/project horizon vs joltz,iirc,or are u in semis still joltz,o ok,gl frend,joltz,i will cheer for u,i painted <:joltzieW:268031910498795520> on my chest,i have face paint on,played too much for honor,i will loudly scream,like viking,so u can win,u can harness energy,aaaaaaaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA,utism,every time i watch battlerite im like,"for honor is so much better, i wanna play for honor",then i play for honor and warden just light attacks me,over and over and over,and parries lights into heavies,over,and over,and can't even be hit,semifinals of the tourney we got falsesly DQ'd from just now,has a warden on ALL 4 TEAMS,the team we lost to in winners,had a warden,we didn't even hit once,lol,i knew he was super broken,but he's even better than warlord/pk,he's like god tier,ya constantly,u can't because his lights catch you before you have time to block post feint,if u ever swing he just interrupts,or parries,not to mention fastest autos in the game + best unblockable in the game + meaty off of grab 50/50,he's got like,a billion options,like PK with range,lol,warden beats everyone,tourney proves it,nobody's even hitting warden,except other warden players,he's nuts,dunno,ya joltz,we 2v1'd him,but he has best defensive mechanics in the game,can't do anything to him still,as i said,can't even hit him,even 2v1,we can't hit him once,lol,joltz ur reading comprehension is so low,i'd assume u were black,joltz,ima be honest,im so mad that reddit and monkeys dq'd me from a tourney i had a decent chance in,i just wanna quit for honor,this is the problem with huge casual games,they're run by like,casual retards,who dont understand what gaming is,and u have to deal with them constantly,in the staff, in matches, on ur team,it's an entire community of single digit age double digit IQ,people,who played dark souls,being rank 1 is useless unless u can prove how superior u are,it's all about stroking your own dick on people,but i cant do that if i get dq'd,for no reason,would've raped these warden players,even tho it's legit not possible,would've done it anyway,i think nikita,is bad hero,😠,i've been up 30 hours,practicing for tourney,get dq'd from tourney for no reason,wtf is life,how can u guys sit here and discuss battlerite,ur mistakes dont matter,ur comp doesn't matter,game outcome is predetermined,every game for weeks we've played like shit,and it goes exactly the same as when we play well,cus the game is like,70% rng,30% dick size,and im packin enough heat to compensate,,rip jeff,get in argument with GF,message jeff,jeff/10,we,are,doing this,does this indirectly show how much better than everyone else i am?,i was saying ranged was 100x stronger than melee and that melee BLEW in this game,5 monthd ago,literally,months*,im sure u guys remember,the constant rants,every 2 seconds,about shifu needing buffs (and by that i mean jumong/oldur needing nerfs),cus range is SO gay in this game,can't do anything,if u outplay them in a 50/50 like 5 times in a row,you'll kill them with 15% hp left,top kek,<:PogChamp:269924172002492417>,xaynox everything u say is so stupid,everything,i could beat u times a billion,using only my left nut,poloma against our comp <:LUL:269941798107873286>,lucie against our comp <:LUL:269941798107873286>,Varesh against our comp <:LUL:269941798107873286>,Any ranged

lose and complain about comp are correct.,In most games, they're just idiot crybabies.,But in BR, they're right a good deal of the time,especially if they're true top players,like me or joltz or blankz,tsm wonnered?,<:PogChamp:269924172002492417>,joltz,wp,you're one step closer to me and averse,rusty doesn',doesn't even begin to describe,im pretty mad,about my play,all 3 of us hit counters, and for the first time me and ninjas (and even rarely averse) were getting outskilled 1v1,i dont think we've ever had to use communication and teamwork to win,we normally just brute force,and crush people,but we were actually worse skill wise,and still won,most fun tournament i can remember,ya, a ton,and we haven't played any rk/ashka,averse wasn't getting beat 1v1, he's modest,but ninjas was losing 60% of the time,and i was losing 99.9%,never played so awful,can't believe we won honestly,i somehow kept morale high and communicated cooldowns really loudly and clearly and effectively, adapted our gameplan inbetween rounds quickly and my adaptations always worked, etc,im surprised i can provide more to the team than just winning 1v1s,but im glad it works out,cus honestly in terms of mechanics,i was fucking deadweight there,terrible play,o./,<@226719375183446016> 1v1,nyy,grow,gay,-10,u 1600 elo shitscrub,i rape u in chess,im as intellectual as 3 teldos,im AT LEAST 400

DOLLARS,FUCK,and my team lost round 1 without me,...,again,LUL,apparently, and this is just what averse says,ninjas only plays as good as the shifu he's with,when im not there, he plays like shit,probably because of the ridiculous offensive pressure i put out, lets ninjas do whatever he wants and he pretty much carries us,but when im not there ninjas is always the first one dead,he's used to me protection,😦,I pressure entire enemy team by myself and get orbs and protect ninjas,and shotcall everything,at the same time,zzzzzzzz,team pls,ROFL,"JUNGLER INC MID","ASHKA FLASH 1:39",at least

water in this keyboard,and completely destroyed it,like even having it plugged in just makes it flashes random colors and completely destroys it,but then i GO TO SLEEP that night,and wake up the next day,and once it's dried it fixes itself,i guess it's waterproof?,wtf,it's the world's greatest keyboard,how can it survive being completely submerged in water,twice,no idea,long story,basically once upon a time my mother flips items she finds for cheap at garage/estate sales for a living,flips them for like,10-20 times the cost,even had her own store doing the same thing,so whenever she sees anything gaming related, she'll pick it up,and just give it to me,cus everything's dirt cheap,she doesn't know shit about computers, but she saw a mechanical keyboard and knew i liked them and it was new in the box for like 5 bucks, so she got it,when i plug it in, it's literally called "mechanical keyboard" under devices,no model number, no brand name, nothing,can't even tell what switches are in it except they're greens or browns or some weird switch,no clue wtf this keyboard is,but it's sick,joltz you'll never ruin the majesty of my keyboard,it is LITERALLY,mechanical keyboard ™,the greatest mechanical keyboard,of all time,idk what switches are in it, how old it is, or how much it costs,and i don't need to,cus i know all i need to know,which is that it's based,I've heard a few times from various top level players that he's widely considered very mediocre,not that good at all,and from watching his play i'd say i agree,me and zyko and turtlerider would smash him,assume you would too,<@250636384774127616> the world will never know,i believe they're greens or browns based on texture,probably greens,aka the worst switch possible,for the worst mechanical keyboard possible,but it's somehow still alive,forever,well,it matters for osu and my wpm,i type like twice as fast on reds,ya i dont really play it anymore,but like,maybe once a week or so i decide to randomly marathon it for like 10 hours,and break my own hands,for fun,and my left hand has been better than they were even in my prime lately,so reds would be interesting,browns and greens are shit,only comparable switch to reds are blues,which are more tactile and only marginally slower,but i want only speed,forever,so reds are best,well,they're the only 2 options for osu nyy,so i've always compared them,blues are basically for accuracy and streaming consistency/keeping rhythm,reds are pure speed/stamina,ya outside of osu blues are my favorite,but i think that's pretty common,the switches work fine,im not rich enough to be elitist about the type of manufactured switch,cherry mx reds good enough for me,on my limited budget,buying a reliable keyboard ik i'll like without spilling water in it,nah,i spend like 70,buy used keyboard with no numpad and no wrist rest that some guy has probably cum inside of while watching anime,🍆,joltz,zyko was praising u,he was like,"joltz's raider is crazy","the mindgames are so insane",i was like "he gets raped by me, rip joltz",then zyko got raped by me too,yaaaaaaa,turtlerider84 is still convinced he's better than me,but i doubt it,he's probably the 2nd best tho,idk zyko might have passed him,he's been playing every day,and i haven't seen him,but his best char is zerker and zerker is bugged aka dogshit rn,so i think i'd beat him,if zerker gets buffed he might win tho,>verosk is playing for honor,aaaaaaaaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA,<:thunking:269957648395403274>,joltz,become better at for honor,so i feel some incentive to play

cocksucking fags,just stay out of my tournament,away from my money,fucking european cucks,of course you'd care,we'd win the entire thing,with 100% certainty,we're not entering cause it's again the rules,we smash every single EU tourney in every NA tourney,we always have,and we always will,until the day i stop breathing,eoekas just because ur a barely below average chess player,doesn't mean

EMOTE,IM PISSED,P I S S E D,klerny i told you already,money has no value to me,pride has none either,there's no reason for me to enter EU tournies when i could sleep instead,both of my teammates feel the same way and also oversleep every EU tournament,we don't care enough to play in them,it's a waste of time,i play on 70 ping in my own region's tournament,about 100 on EUwest,you think I wouldn't crush you on 150?,you must be joking,i've played in EU tournaments before, with substitutes and not even my full team,and I still get MVP every single round,as a one man team,ninjas gets 27 score a round because he isn't used to high ping,while i get 1700,we haven't entered with our full team,our full team cannot lose,won't ever.,you mean my teammates were shit for 4 rounds, then I killed all 3 of them myself round 5,Then I got mvp 4 straight rounds,and reverse swept them by myself,I'll say this much,if i was on 20 ping like ninjas,nobody would ever beat me,ever,from anywhere,that's why if a LAN ever happens you'll see,I'd be surprised if we even dropped a round.,to anybody,globally,outkast,why are you guys trying to mimic us,zzzz,yeah,entering the SLS tourney with the same comp as us,no,i kicked you out of your spot,that's cause of personality, not skill.,He was already teammates with you guys, and averse isn't the kind of guy to ditch his teammates to have "a better chance of winning" when he was guaranteed to win anyway.,If we're looking at just skill, ninjas and I were always better.,by a lot,implying you'll make it to us,you guys will probably lose to neewha's team,our comp isn't as good as we make it look,no,we'll never lose to anybody,until time stops,i was half-memeing when i said it 3 months ago,but here i am, still saying it,we won't ever lose,that much im sure of,averse has been really bad lately,but he's actually been playing every day again since the new patch came out,so im sure that'll stop,and we'll go back to dominating again,i never became rusty in the first place,and even rusty ninjas is the best support player in the world,so we're fine,not even worth the time,outkast and i have always had a mutual respect,he taught me some stuff about sirius/shifu when i was still a noob,hey, don't look at me,that comp was nightmarish for shifu,every comp is hard for jumong,character fucking sucks,lol,only works because me and ninjas can 2v3 every team in the world and still win,and then averse holds down m1,ironically, the only team we wouldn't be able to 2v3 and win is one with averse on it,but he's on our team,so we take those,but outkast you guys should make a pretty scary team,idk if you'll be 2nd or 3rd in the tournament,I hear from averse everyone's scrimming every game,that's good,i might actually get to try during the tournament,Oh please,you guys should get 1st or 2nd,Btw klerny,how'd SLS get tipped off about the EU smurfs?,even players like me dont know all the smurf accounts,well, everyone knows those,im saying the less obvious ones,i wonder if i could just DQ any team i didn't like by telling SLS they're EU smurfs,I bet i could,top player privilege,to be fair,my team loses to randoms on NA ping without me,and i play on 70 ping,¯\_(ツ)_/¯,eli,first round,to randoms,as they always do without me,they've yet to make it to the 2nd round once without me,which makes even less sense than you'd expect, because averse and ninjas teamed for a 2v2 tourney i overslep,and they 10-0'd every team,including like 3 EU teams,lol,they just blow without me,xpanic is a fucking beast,lol,i think that guy is good,me and ninjas almost lost to him once,and he was with misterpink,so that tells u how good he is,<@141175772588146688> sketch/outkast,are the strongest,well, would be if they were in prime condition anyway,im not sure,neewha is 3rd,ITF is 4th,are we not?,oh yeah huh,forgot they got invited,who invites them anyway,zzzz,to be fair,what are you gonna do,only invite our team?,i mean, you could,the outcome would be the same,god man i've been so rusty in battlerite lately,i've been trying to make myself play,but every single game i play is a onesided 3-0 smash,where i make 0 mistakes,and im like "i guess im not rusty after all" after like 10 games,and get off,sketch couldn't beat me even if i played with one hand,i am,he's the 2nd best,there's a huge difference between me and every other shifu,including condemned and corrupted,nobody plays the char half as well as me,w/m?,110 on this shit keyboard,normally like 140,i only use my index fingers to type though,"be nice" -

them,people need to get better,im tired of being an entire team,zzzz,f2p will make no difference,everyone else are fish,im a L E O P L U R A D O N,verosk,nobody can beat me,a player like that isn't

the best player,and i oversleep half the tournies,they're trying to give people who have talent the incentive to practice and try,but it's all futile,me,by a ton,ninjas is better than averse too,just still worse than me,there's been a couple times averse has tilted at me and said he was gonna quit the team,i told him straight up,we'll win everything without him,don't need him anymore,ya, i did,and he permabanned me from his twitch chat,and didn't quit,of course he didn't,he needs us,and honestly deep down, we need him too,but i'd never admit that to him,can't let him get a big head,averse already thinks he runs everything,gotta put him in his place,arakune > all,well, i stole him from you,and he only joined because we were so good he couldn't say no,now we're friends,but it wasn't always like that,we were the best option before you guys quit.,He just doesn't abandon his teammates,he isn't that kind of guy,same,idk, who cares,nah,nyy,averse watches WAY too much slice of life anime,he feels too much guilt,wouldn't ever abandon his team,i mean, if his team was consistently losing and the new team would let him win, that's different,but to go from 100% winrate to a better team with 100% winrate? it's all the same to him,and im sure he doesn't want to seem unloyal,honestly im the same way,if i got an offer from a better team somehow in NA, i would say no,I've been with my team a while, and we never lose,no reason to switch,mostly cus i'd never abandon ninjas,it's weird cus like, i could see averse and me parting ways and being on different teams,but it's the #1 and #2 players, it doesn't make sense for us to,and i'll never ditch ninjas,ever,i think the only reason i can imagine us being against eachother is because that used to be the grand finals of every tournament,but nowadays,i can't see us parting,Ninjas is 14.,That's why I won't ditch him,he's like my little bro,i protect ninjas,i trained ninjas into the monster he is now,he's become so good even i have trouble,makes me proud,that he's so good,nah, i wouldn't outkast,me and ninjas lost tournaments for like,2 months,and i didn't ditch him,i met ninjas at grade 11 and i could tell even then that we'd be the best team,and we ended up becoming the best team,that guy has a ton of potential,ya im talking 2v2,like, even if we started losing now,i wouldn't ditch ninjas,because me and him still have untapped potential,we aren't trying our hardest yet,<@158305555037945856> i am glad that they didnt patch the fucking game, i was actually afriad that the mid feb patch would apply all the redesigns so they already ahndled the situation better than i expected them to have handled it. the problem with telling people is that youd have to do it in advance. if something like this happens for the first time its usually somewaht spontaneous and you wanna make it a mystery, so i feel like people should have played the game in anticipation of something like this happening along the line, but that might just be me. same shit basically happened in dota with the international. while i agree that people knowing about stuff would be in the games interest, i also understand the companys point of view because they kinda have to eaxpect that all people who are truly interested in the games competition are competeting most of the time anyway. its not even in their interest to reward people who stopped playing the game, they are gonna come back for the qualifier anyway,<:LUL:269941798107873286>,😦,i honestly look at nikita,like ninjas,he's like an adorable little brother,but EU version,but i

rotating back and covering safely,condemned is the most overaggressive player,corrupted is too,they just like,hang themselves,they miss a counter and then space and instead of backing up and waiting 8 seconds he's like,"im spearing in","here i go",spears in,dies,and im like,well uh,u did it,u landed the spear,wp,condemned goes "when i have no cooldowns left and then i E into 3 people and die, it means shifu fucking sucks","i need emergency buffs",if he never wants to win again,sure,nerf the only aggressive champ in the game,nerf the only melee champ in the game,i can't wait,i'll play jumong,averse will play taya,ninjas will play lucie,we'll go full fucking nigger,if shifu gets nerfed,ya,EVERYONE IN CHAT TYPE "SHADOW IS A STUPID NEIGHBOR",,l e g e n d,,MARTH,,,,,M A R T H,A,R,T,H,o ya, i should've mentioned,i had an opportunity,yesterday,to set up a battlerite LAN,but i told him nah,they host them for CS, halo, rocket league, etc,but they were worried about the potential turn out for battlerite players,and i was like "yeah they won't show up",you just suck outkast,well, not you so much,sketch is weak.,Given, you're the second weakest,tukez,i beat your freya on EU ping,u can't coach people,YES,YES,YES,<@98465602670186496> fair enough, i have 200 ping to USW,and 269 to USE,kuya,the fuck you say nigga,<@116832698151993352>,why dont you ask my opinion,except i did,"yes",fuck u,nah averse, you're wrong,jumong is shit,no matter how good you are,no,he's shit vs anything,ashka is objectively better,in ALL comps,does more damage and is safer and has better combo potential,1 auto = 300 damage,ashka ignite,fair char,ya,ashka is top 1 champ in the game,behind #0,Shifu,As long as i exist shifu will be #0 champ in the game,kuya,are you guys out?,or in losers,if you lose to stro in 3v3 idk what to tell you,you're hopeless,he's trash,nobody's tiled,tilted,none of you are good,none of the 6 players in that game,are good,ur probably the best out of them kuya,which is saying something,cus you aren't that good,it's like calling the sky blue,you can disagree if u want,ur just wrong,ya,me > humans,:^),my nigga verosk <:PogChamp:282891715810033665>,im not bullying,kuya's team will win,because kuya's the best player,gl in the real tournament though,i'll crush you if you make it that far,no he doesn't,i could beat 10 stros by myself,we're different,averse,ur the only player i know,who i don't think i could beat 2 of by myself,i'd still win 1v1 tho,dunno,ur gay nigger champs both got nerfed,so now it's fair,shifu still not rank 1 in the game,ashka better,raidan better,or whatever his name is,raigon?,something like that,there exists no good,only unrealized evil,i bring hope to the sinners,and death to the people,<:megu:278314646912630788>,damo's ashka is weak,sky's was a lot better,back when he played it,sky was genuinely in my like top 5 most respected NA players for a long time, before he started playing freya,his ashka and RK were both amazing,actually amazing,especially his RK,he was the only person who could beat me 1v1 for so long,i mean within an actual match.,His RK would stomp my shifu,in tournament matches,for a long time,i still think he's one of the hardest people to face,nah, shifu crushes RK,if you lose to RK as shifu,you should put a bullet in your own skull,shifu beats everyone 1v1 except jumong,Which is weird,cause jumong actually sucks ass,lol,oh ya,well,forgot,and iva's bad too,whatever these niche picks dont matter,in tournament setting,nah,rook loses now,after the nerf,rook is supposed to beat shifu,but he's underpowered,beat me?,you're joking,3-0,in my favor,2 of them were 5-0,you got close to winning the first one,2nd one didn't count,cus i killed myself,with rite picks,do you want to rematch?,if you're so insistent,and besides, back then rook crushed shifu,it was a 100-0 matchup,that i won anyway,because im me,rook got gutted,the battlerite rework is rip,he's strictly worse than he was in every way,now your m2 AND r aren't made by niggers for niggers,they're normal moves,used by normal hard working white people,cus u only play against someone decent enough to exploit them every 10 games,that's a ton in battlerite,im lucky if i play someone who makes me think every 30 games,no,it's that way everywhere,good players don't exist,i can play with my brain completely turned off for like 3 hours,end up going like 22-5 or something,and all 5 losses were godawful teammates,what use is it proving you won a 100-0 matchup,now that it's more like 80-20,it'd be rape,no, i dont want you to waste your time,because what i said was ingame, not in the discord,so you'd never find it,you're just like every other irrelevant worm hansa,nothing,aggressive and defensive aren't the same thing,you're trash,i'd crush you,why would i fight with fists,im over 18,zzzz,jail is gay,i'll take ur word for it,we'll say u won if it'll make u shut up,not that you'd ever have a chance in any kind of real setting,or now for that matter,if i meet one more weeb motherfucker,with some loli faggot ass discord picture,im gonna light them up,🔥,degenerate trash,if u think i won't go on a 6 hour rant at you,that can only be stopped by banning me,you're mistaken,6 hours is like,the morning shift,i got 2 more shifts,dammit,i like u guys

whether or not it's worth the time and effort to enter a tourney you're unlikely to win.,If you're entering with the intention of winning, obviously it's worth it.,But you should be more realistic.,Whether he is or not doesn't matter,We don't lose on NA ping,I know, i'm just saying.,Even with that assumption, it's still cocky to come to NA with the intention of winning against us,Of

harsh,but i really didn't think i was,rip exblack,can't face reality,it's hard sometimes,<@150354957613268992> listen to some camellia,if u want some autism level drops,that shit's 🔥,Us, Neewha, ITF's team, and jeter's team.,intheflesh,Wrong.,1st is vs 4th,2nd vs 3rd.,Standard setup.,...,there's 4 teams,i just hopped into conversation,o,i see,u meant groups,yes, presumably,only way that makes sense,otherwise we'd rematch neewha again,which is rly dumb,seed wise it's still 1st vs 4th,2nd vs 3rd,dont believe that's the case,it's based on either 1 of 2 things,game scores,or it's simply qualifier bracket is 4th seed,cus qualifier < invited,ur literally down syndrome,the tournament format is just shit,shut up and listen,don't type anything,the only thing u lose from losing is seeding position, IE who you need to play first match the first game of day two,You don't begin in losers brackets.,Everyone resets.,Which is bullshit for 2 teams that didn't drop a set,but what can u do,they've even explicitly stated that the top 4 get placed into a double elimination bracket,like a NEW double elimination bracket,at least if my understanding of the rules is right,since seeds don't matter with only 4 teams,  qualifying in losers is exactly the same as qualifying in winners,Meaning it was technically plausible that you wanted to intentionally sandbag a game to face an easier first round opponent day 2,Funny how that works.,good tourney,ya,it's just retarded,we shouldn't have to eliminate neewha's team 2 more times,or jeter's,they already lost once,doesn't make sense to me,it's not about who ur playing against,it's about the fact that everyone starts on winners side.,yesterday's losses were meaningless,except it makes it so you have to play against the person on winner's side today round 1 instead of losers,that's the only difference,literally the only difference,No sense in a group stage with 8 teams,simply make a seeded double elimination bracket,based on invitational seed,It makes perfect sense,the higher seeds are rewarded for being higher seeds.,As they are in all games. Always.,The lowest seed has to face off against the highest seed early, and so on. 2nd best plays against 2nd worst, etc,I mean SLS can run a tournament however they want,and as finlev said, i've seen worse formats,but i've certainly seen better.,it just isn't fair to the top 2 teams in either bracket is all,seeding wasn't random,Except for qualified teams.,The top 4 teams had specific seed numbers,we were invited as "X" seed, so were identity crisis and neewha's team,not just invited to the tournament and shuffled,They did it based on battlerekt wins from my understanding,however, they didn't do it based on only recent performance,which is why neewha's team was 2nd,they havent entered in forever,but they won a lot when they did,lol,,balanced char,lol,lol,lol,my friend,it's her 2nd game ever,How'd the match go,Joltz's team in losers?,I saw it wasn't looking good.,but im streaming so,didnt watch the whole thing.,joltz,u guys can run it back through losers,i believe in u,do it,FUCK croak,Ninjas - Today at 5:14 PM

better get on his hands and knees,and worship me like the god i am,actually,im gonna go harass him right now,for fun,brb,im gonna tell him to take his meaningless existence,and jump off the golden

very normal prize distribution",yeah, considering i've competed in about 200 tournaments and i've NEVER seen one where first gets less than 50%,seems pretty normal to me,fucking retard,No, he has 0

superior to me,idc who 2gd is or what he's done,u dont talk shit to the god,it just doesn't work that way,well,i passed him anyway,i pass all people,im actually so unreal talented,that i can pass anyone at anything,whenever i want to,i just DECIDE to be superior to them,and am,it's not important,no matter how they change the game we'll always win,it's not worth talking about,there were clips?,i didnt even watch them,changes dont matter,lol,if they reduced hitboxes by a significant margin,i'd barely even get hit,i think i could just strafe back and forth for like,30-40 seconds,and get hit twice,world*,this is me you're talking to,lol,we've shown already that playing melee is fine.,Even against defensive comps,You simply use your pressure as aggressive melee to push them out,then you don't actually fight them cause you'll die,you just get mid and ult,cus ults are broken,it'd be cool if they increased the skillcap,i can't imagine how good our team will be,we're the 3 top mechanical players in the game,for sure,i think we'd all become a lot better,might just kill the scene tbh,remove all hope of anyone else winning,i get the feeling if they make the game higher skillcap,we're gonna have like,10-0 grand finals EVERY tournament,with 80%+ team health,every round,don't know,cus sirius shifu is a shit comp,if we play good characters it's pretty good,like when he plays lucie and im shifu,or if we play sirius croak,we're pretty nuts,but sirius shifu just sucks,ya,ninjas lucie hasn't been played in 3 months,we were trying to play a hypothetical counterpick comp,and i think it would've worked if ninjas wasn't getting raped by finlev so bad,i dont even blame him,bakko lucie is rly hard,and he hasn't played it in forever,just wanted to try it out,finlev's bakko is insane sometimes,i don't ever think it's as good as nikita's,but it's good,i promise u,sometimes he just,becomes a good player,ONLY on that champ,and he'll be like 2-3 mindgame levels deep,super fast flicks,plays really solid,dude,i've been the one calling him a shit player,for EVER,i know,but his bakko has days where he looks insane,it's pretty rare,especially now,ya,that's the other thing,i think finlev is shit,but all of you are shit too,so not really worth discussing,he'd probably smash EU,nah,we're respected at this point,by everyone,no other choice,lol,everyone thinks ninjas is better than averse,everyone,including me,and the only reason people dont see me as good as them is because they dont realize im one man comms, rotations, gameplans strats and im the only one who burns cooldowns for all 3 players on the other team,they get crushed without me for a reason,it's cause im god,apparently they do,i could beat the other players in my sleep,o also,someone link that katey blogg again,so i have something to laugh at while i eat,zzzzzzzz,u guys suck,its ok,"with the m1 changes, ranged champions now stand completely still at the start of their m1, but regain

SLS,well, the ability to dodge poke in neutral seems nice,but it doesn't matter,cc's way too broken now,honestly, our comp will probably become unviable now,since jumong isn't a combo char,and nobody on our team has a stun,just incaps/pets,no,im the best croak,on the planet,lol,real talk,this combined with the shifu nerfs,im almost certainly maining croak now,i mean how can u not,shifu was the only thing that stood a chance against him before,but now he's got no competition,it was like when i mained shifu before the freya or bakko nerfs,and then they both got nerfed,how could u not play him',o ya rook got nerfed too,shifu op because every other melee gets nerfed,nerf shifu as a result,dont ever nerf ranged or anything,they're SUPER underpowered,zone attack,light overhead,zone attack,magic missle,magic missle,magic missle,so wait,what's everyone's opinion on them not touching melee m1's,at all,u can't just make melee m1's still be slow 9 damage if ur gonna make jade/ashka even faster and higher damage,the compensation for standing still doesn't matter,since u can just trade in melee range,makes croak the only good melee,since he only needs to m1 you once,and has stealth,actually ranged standing still when they m1 makes croak WAY better,and ranged m1's doing more damage makes them better on his team for comboing too,how overpowered can this champion get,lol,why does everyone want melee nerfed when they've needed buffs since the game's inception,zzz,i agree the hitboxes are retarded,reduce them and give me more damage,just like ranged,i dont think any melee played would complain about that,well,they can't leave melee m1's the same,it doesn't matter if u dont miss when ur outputting less dps than the ranged ur hitting,otherwise we're in croak

to find good shows,I quit BR.,If you need a reason why, look at my masterbattlerite profile,I'm done.,No, we won the tournament.,But that doesn't matter.,What matters is that I'm shit at the game.,you're looking for the 15% winrate drop,and 50% winrate today,over 7 hours of play,o/,Thanks.,good idea,that's the only way to balance channeled ults the way people want,the issue as it stands right now is that people petrify u right when ult starts and u ult them again, so people want the pet to instantly drain all the ult, but a 25% meter ability shouldn't completely outclass an ult,it would be sick if you could mindgame cancel your ult into moves like shifu's counter or space and only lose a portion of the ultimate meter, maybe like half,well, as is right now that's a straight buff to channeled ults,the downside should be if you get hard cc'd out of your ult you should lose the whole thing,or minimum the same you'd lose for cancelling,the idea is just like, for me as shifu a lot of the time i start my ult and i know they'll petrify so i want to counter or something, but it's almost always better to just take the 50 damage and like a quarter of my meter loss and eat the petrify, since countering causes me to lose all my meter.,Idk, it just opens up more opportunities for outplays and punishes you harder for fucking up with your ult.,give me options out of my ult other than keep ulting and kill all my own meter by doing anything else,like even the option to exspace at the end of your ult as shifu or sirius is really interesting, because while you get the increased movespeed/duration/healing immaterial, you lose out on dps you would've got if you'd let your ult run out all the way,so it's situationally good, situationally bad,game needs more of that,well yeah,it gives u the option to use any move out of ur utl,an incap, a counter, an escape, whatever,it has to have a weakness otherwise ulting just becomes a super powerful mixup move,where u force ur opponent to react,it's virtually always the smart move,like 10% of the time it's worth wasting ur entire ult meter to counter a move and kill someone,and that 10% is when them hitting your counter will kill them, but your ult wouldn't already kill them.,Again, pretty rare scenario.,,kms,,im gonna throw my monitor through my fucking wall,real talk,"fits poloma's theme",her theme is being

what's your problem you fucking fag
You're so stubborn and fucking retarded dude
i can't tolerate your dumb ass anymore
I said raigon was good, you brought up 1v1, I said I'd 1v1 you to prove a point and you refuse to do it
then u just sit here and spout ur down syndrome opinion on game balance despite having no experience as or against a good raigon
the only reason I even bothered telling you is so you wouldn't be mad af when I played him in the next tournament
because im not picking him to troll, he's actually super strong
and then after u spout ur garbage opinion u can't back up over and over again you're just like "ok dude whatever i don't even care" like some kind of xbox live faggot kiddie
jesus fucking christ you're a retard dude
fuck off,https://twitter.com/MisterRoasty/status/837968892051980288,so we're like a THOUGHT,or a DREAM,that's a WISP,in the mind of a GOD,NIKITA <:PogChamp:282891715810033665>,NIKITA <:PogChamp:282891715810033665>,NIKITA <:PogChamp:282891715810033665>,MADNESS,IMPRISONING ME,NIKITA <:PogChamp:282891715810033665>,<:PogChamp:282891715810033665>,all i do,is watch samurai champloo,shit's 200% fire,my nigga jin,is straight baller,faces off against the hand of god,he's too lit,to quit,autism,:^),real talk,that format's so bad,the only reason is that learning a second champ isn't plausible in this game at the highest level,the reality is, even the people who only play one champ AND are top 8 tournament contenders,are normally fairly bad,im saying u can't ban any champs period,because people are too shit at the game,even people like me with 2500 games on ONLY one champ,aren't playing perfect,so the secondaries would be godawful,and since after 2500 games it's still imperfect, learning a secondary and sometimes even a third champ who also fit into your comp is impossible,it won't be done even given an unlimited amount of time,it'd be years,nah,it's too much depth,making the game harder when everyone already sucks is pointless,forcing people to learn 3 champs when they can't learn 1 is pointless,pointless,pointless,pointless,but varesh doesn't need a ban,he's absolutely dogshit,not even viable,poloma is as strong as 3 varesh's put together,and the best part is,i've been saying this since before poloma varesh was even a thing,poloma R E T A R D E D broken,u said "ban poloma ban varesh let us play game",varesh doesn't need a ban,use it on something banworthy instead,well no,u ban poloma every single game,no matter what,always.,100% ban rate.,Poloma is like zed in the LCS or something,she's far too strong in competent hands,needs to be banned every game,in every comp,or she's first pick instant win,i've said poloma was OP since before varesh got buffed,and i bitch about poloma every single time i play against her,when I was 24-3 on raigon,all 3 of my losses were to different poloma players,and her teammate was different every time too,i can list all the gamebreakingly overpowered champions in order for you right now,there's 4 of them,if u really want to know,1. Poloma,2. Ashka,3. Croak,4. Probably Jade,no, you're shit.,Jade is OP because croak is OP,and they're too good together,jade croak still strongest comp in the game,"ashka is shit",actual worst player,i've ever spoken to,in my entire life,all i do is play against ashka players who 3-0 me,on any other champ,and 3-0 them in under 2 minutes,they dont even get 3 digit score one round,u have more escapes than shifu has gapclosers,and shifu has the most gapclosers in the game,and ur ranged,with the highest dps in the game,and CC for anti ranged AND anti melee,ezmo demolishes shifu but, like all other characters, he loses to every single ranged champion,firewall is way less broken than his petrify,both of them are retarded tho,ezmo is really easy, and really gay,but he has more than enough weaknesses,kind of like shifu actually,M E D A L L I O N S,M E D A L L I O N S,S T U N F U C K S T U D I O S,everyone i've spoken to said medallions were shit cause they were overly complex,i think u guys are looking for a game people don't like,infinite skillcap infinite complexity,i want that game too,but what i want more than that game is esports money and a fnatic sponsorship,so fuck making an infinite skill ceiling game for me to rape people in,im just trying to get paid,and not hate the game,yeah, of course klerny,they gave the game a chance,I am?,I played for the first time in 15 days on for honor the other day,ran into a prestige 11 orochi player,and a prestige 10 warden,who were duoing,ended the game 6-0,didn't even get hit once,didn't get HIT,once,that game is below me,and the people who play it are also below me,if there's for honor tournaments, i'll play in them and win with zyko,englado,i won him,i played against funleev,and i won him,oh?,for how much money?,i haven't been keeping up with the game at all,like AT all,if there's money in it i'll play,not that there's any reason for me to,i don't need to become any better to win tournaments,klerny,ur opinion on bans is wrong,i don't care what ur response is,it's wrong,there's no reason for bans,they're nonsensical,ok,but ur the only person on earth with ur opinion,that's why it isn't worth arguing,if ur the only person with an opinion,ur opinion is wrong,no matter how good u make it sound,Nyy is saying there's no mirror matches in a moba, they also have significantly more chars to work from and as a result many of them are guaranteed to be ludicrously overpowered. A ban system makes sense and is necessary from both a strategic and balance pov. In battlerite however, since mirror matches are allowed (and should be) and ability homogenization (or whatever the fuck it's called) makes it so no one ability or charactert will be insanely retarded, a ban system makes no logical sense and has no place in the game.,<@141175772588146688>,nikita,ur shit,1v1,i'll defeat u and ur entire country,simultaniously,with my giant dick,,where u at nikita,ya,,9/11,would 9/11 again,Nikita's the best player i've ever played against,im dumbfounded,im getting raped,this shit is impossible,he doesn't make any mistakes,well that's a comp thing, joltz' comp is amazing against bakko,and nikita's teammates aren't that good,nikita is a monster,tho,well,i had to like,wake up,to keep up with him,he's super good,smash 4 is so bad,SO bad,ya nikita is,without a doubt,the best player i've played against,i think he's better than averse,GG.,I'm dumbfounded you're that good on 150 ping.,especially considering im on 21 ping,and i was hitting really nasty reaction counters.,Sure.,last one nikita?,kk,shifu vs bakko,his bakko is unreal,im lucky shifu wins the mu,nah,i made more mistakes than him,shifu just beats bakko,lol,there's no way,i never said that,i DID say,that he has moments,where he looks as good as nikita,or better,but nikita could be having a bad day too,wasn't 100% fair,nikita was winning 2-0 when i said he was the best player i was against,i reverse swept him after that,he woke me up,im playing like he was now lol,no mistakes,,as if i dont keep track if ur meter,of*,i always knew how much u had,assumed u were doing the same,Nah. I'm bored of this.,They were good games nikita,u wont win on ping that high against me in a matchup ur character loses,it's hopeless,didnt what hansa,there were a couple times i hit bulwark because i wasn't sure if it was up or not,found out from averse yesterday,he doesn't use a mental timer or rhythm to determine when cds are up like most people do,he LITERALLY counts,in his head,to 8 or 10 or 15 or whatever,so he's never off,i should start doing it,but it's so much mental work,nikita i told u we're done,i don't want to play anymore,we can play some other time,i'll practice against u every day if u want,with practice this good i won't lose,xaynox no, he does everything,he has situational awareness of every player on the map, and all of their cds, and has seperate timers for all of them,For example if he needs to keep track of multiple abilities, like a space and a Q, but the Q gets used first, he'll do a quick mental calculation to go "Okay he used his Q when I had counted to 4 for his space, meaning his Q will be up 2-3 seconds after his Space is." He doesn't actually have to count multiple different things at once.,It's honestly brilliant,idk if he does or not, im not in his head,that's what he told me,well, he's also our backline and only has to worry about the cds of people he can see,he even said he can sometimes keep track of mine/ninjas cds,while keeping track of the opponents,dunno dude,he's a machine,ASK,HIM,<@105221541024772096>,im telling u it isn't as insane as it sounds,he only has to keep track of people he's focusing on and are on his screen,He's way in the back, almost always in a 1v1 where he can't see us and we can't see him,on top of that, if there's like 4 people on screen but im 1v1ing one guy and he's 1v1ing one guy, he doesn't have to keep track of the guy im 1v1ing because I keep track of it and call it.,It's not like he watches every single player at all times,just shit we miss,ya for me i think it would be hard just to count more than 2 abilities,holy shit nyy,that's brilliant,that's a WAY better way,to do it,u see the cd get popped,take a quick peek at the clock,do fast mental math,super easy to know exactly when it'll be up,the only issue is then u have to look at the clock again at the time it's up,it's way easier to just count 1... 2... 3.. etc and then if they use a second ability in that time go "it'll be 3 seconds after im done counting the other ability is up",But with 3+ abilities,NO idea how u do it,the reality is, averse probably can't keep track of more than 2 cds at once unless they were used at the exact same time or something.,But if you can keep EXACT track of up to 2 abilites at once, and use the normal "feel" everyone else uses for the rest,you're rarely gonna be wrong or way off,or not know when someone has something,Averse - Today at 5:30 PM
I keep track of ur guys cds sometimes as well
very rarely
its usually ur space or ninjas counter/space,Arakune - Today at 5:30 PM
how many cds at once
I was saying that like 2 was plausible and practical
but then everything after that was too hard
have to use feel at that point
cus u can just base the 2nd cd off how far into the first CD u were and do some easy mental math
but 3+ abilities is like impossible,Averse - Today at 5:31 PM
I get a feel for most of them, but I can count down around 3-4 at once for specific seconds,u heard it here first,3-4,at once,idk how you do 3+,2 is easy,3 is impossible,well, it's easy when ur just 1v1ing on jumong,but the fact that he also has like, THE best space iframes and stuff on jumong and his aim is good,It makes sense why his counter baiting is so much better than anyone else i've played against,nikita stop bully me,i dont want to beat u anymore,nikita,u are like ninjas,but older,slow reactions,u will never be the ninjas,why do u want to play against me so bad,i get that ur

finals,feels good man,While the feelings of frustration people can feel from playing against stealth is something we want to address, I would not agree that it completely lacks counterplay or effectively works as immaterial.
There are plenty of abilities in the game that can be used against stealth effectively and right after someone has used stealth they are still predictable / readable enough.
We have talked about Croak EX Q several times, taking your feedback into consideration. We haven't found a replacement/change for him that we're satisfied with yet however. For Varesh, he's someone we're looking at for the upcoming M1-changes in regards to his M1/M2 usage and as such we wanted to refrain from changing anything that might be work spent in vain as we change up other stuff
Stealth can be used in many different ways in those games and it is more important for players to be able to counteract stealth directly as the possibility space for where a character with stealth can be is many times larger than in Battlerite.,RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE,mfw you try to convince me romance anime is good
jeff's watched like 400 anime
on his own and with his girlfriend
even though she's a girl she has extremely similar tastes
because "taste" aren't real and people with common sense just like good well made shows with interesting plot and good characters
not over the top cute autism cashgrab waifu pillow selling sellout trash shows
like you,^ me to averse,kms,he's the worst ever,aka,everything averse loves,just gifs of schoolgirls making cute faces at eachother,that's literally all he watches,and enjoys,"because it's cute",i mean to be fair, ur as bad as him in that sense nyy with ur megumin shit,no romance anime can EVER be good,i talked to jeff extensively about it,he's the anime god,insists romance anime can't ever be good and most of them aren't even watchable,And, from my limited personal experience with them,i completely agree,they're godawful,110% of the time,u can't have a preference that wrong,arguing that a pink haired girl cutely winking at a purple haired girl (both of which look 8 years old btw) is better than something with real substance, plot, pacing, characters, budget, etc like hxh2011 or hajime no ippo,isn't possible,period,there exist 0 exceptions,To be fair, hxh2011 was trash beyond the greed island arc,but i digress,or parasyte or any other mad house anime for that matter,they're all godlike,except one punch man but i digress,Im not saying they don't have substance.,I'm saying they have not only less substance than a "real anime" 100% of the time, but the substance they do have is ALSO extremely uninteresting and one dimensional 100% of the time,it will never be better,strictly fact,It can't be as interesting as shows with, again, good plot and characters and story,that actually make u care about what's going on,even shows like the ones ur describing with interesting premises aren't as well executed,because dramas never have good plot or story comparatively to a good anime.,It isn't that they can't, they just don't.,They're two different styles of show.,One type of person likes one type (averse) the other likes the other type (me),averse is objectively wrong in this case,for having simpler, almost always objectively worse taste,in terms of plot, characters, production value, story, pretty much every possible metric,even the romance and comedy aspects of like, serious good anime are often times better than shows centered around just that,because they beat a dead horse nonstop,hxh2011 isn't that good,It's probably just outside my top 5 shows,But that's only because the chimera ant arc is MEGA dogshit,rest of the show's really good,like top tier,The focus on the characters and plot in those shows is still far more than I've seen in any romance or drama.,Even without being the main focus,Hence, my point.,Shonen and any real show even do the few things niche shows set out to do better than them,almost always,im saying,i could suffer through the entire show,i'd still be like "why am i not watching hajime no ippo",100% of the time,actually, a great shonen to describe the problem im talking about is nanatsu no taizai aka seven deadly sins,that show has all the problems of harem/comedy/drama/romance shows, but it's actually some powerlevel ridiculous fight "normal anime" shit,But the show's /terrible/,it isn't a matter of preference, it's a matter of the quality of the show,and shonen's almost always better,nyy - Today at 12:31 AM
that is if the person is interested in fighting plot lines to begin with. if thats not the case then the genre itself is worthless to them becuase of that aspect alone,are you out,of your,FUCKING,MIND,you're calling me closed minded for disliking every romance/comedy/drama anime I've actually WATCHED and given a fair chance,but drama can still be a good genre,because "some people hate ALL ANIME FOCUSED AROUND PLOTLINES WITH FIGHTING",???????????,how am i the closedminded one here,especially when the fighting anime are better made objectively,nyy - Today at 12:31 AM

It's about the quality of the show.,You're really not getting it.,I'm telling you, I've watched the kind of show you're talking about, and the quality/depth is always lower/worse,It's plain to the human eye.

one pieces characters have so much more development than any character in any romance anime made,Trynd - Today at 12:38 AM
and its a shounen
soo,jeff knows,he knows,I mean, not much of a laugh,the show is LITERALLY,500 episodes of nothing but character development,never seen a show with slower pacing in my entire life,the characters just existing and doing miscellanious shit is the entire show,...which is 800 episodes long,it's both?,i can't argue with u when u just say stuff that's wrong,"same characters essentially",drastically different,no comment,Trynd - Today at 12:40 AM
in one piece? its obviously both,Trynd - Today at 12:40 AM

in one piece? its obviously both,it's definitely both,u can't just WORLD BUILD,for 500 episodes,are u kidding me,well that's true joltz, but also not what we're arguing,we're arguing one piece characters are better than ANIME drama/romance/anything else character,pretty much straight up,Trynd - Today at 12:40 AM
backstory is specifically meant for character development
and every main character and most side characters have backstory
as well as highly developed and specific personalities for the characters where as in a romance anime you have a set generic kind of female and male character almost every time
with the same personality
and same story
every time,it was put into writing by jeff,ur welcome,Trynd = Jeff,God.,nobody has ever been more legit than jeff,well, i'll tell u straight up,i can't argue with u about one piece,because im only 140 episodes into it, just started watching it a couple weeks ago,but it's been EXCLUSIVELY plot/worldbuilding so far,140 episodes in,soooooooo,there's been 0 fights lasting longer than 1 episode,that much im certain of,in fact,i dont think there's been one that's lasted longer than 5 or 6 minutes,literal minutes real time,I mean as I said, I'm 1/6th through the show and it's been ONLY plot/backstory/character&world development for 140 episodes. There haven't been any fights over 5 minutes long, even the big bads they build up for 40 episodes,It's like 99.3% plot,lol,Trynd - Today at 12:46 AM
if he thinks a shitty 1-2 season romance anime can have real character development he is actually retarded,except they aren't nyy,because i watched them,2 weeks ago,there's NO FIGHT IN THE SHOW,over 5 minutes,at this point,140 episodes in,in fact, go find one,i'll wait right here,the point is they don't spend the rest of the show doing nothing,they spend it world building,and introducing characters and their backstories and progressing the plot,virtually no fighting happens,at all,Trynd - Today at 12:48 AM
he has clearly never seen or read one piece
so its not worth discussing
lol,Trynd - Today at 12:48 AM
there's no real character development in a 24 episode show
of any kind,To be fair, backstory is often the first piece of understanding a character so they can then develop,but i digress,What's wrong with that? there's still enough of those events to make the characters have more depth than a drama.,Because it's 700 episodes,seems to happen like, fairly often in what I've watched,Trynd - Today at 12:50 AM
one piece characters have more development than characters from any romance anime and its obvious if you know what all of them have been through, through each arc and death
people like one piece for the world building and character development
people like romance animes because they are single weebs with waifu pillows,You're implying that there's only one or two such events that meaninfully change a character of the course of a 700 episode show?,1200 manga chapters?,Are you shitting me?,It also doesn't change one character, it changes several/many,due to the nature of the situation,Trynd - Today at 12:52 AM
ive watched plenty of romance animes and they are all exactly the same
yet no other anime is anything like one piece

i mean legit anyone with a fucking brain who watches anime knows romance is as generic as you can get
with characters
what is this guy lmao,all i read was the same thing I say to averse. "If you look at the screen you can simply see it's better by looking at it and observing it using the 4 senses humans have, not counting smell",Which is also correct.,No more complex explanation is necessary, but he and I have both already given you one,you just won't listen to reason,It was already proven and examples were given,hold on, let me copy paste it again for you,since you're incapable of reading,how much the characters have changednot only in their strength

what is this guy lmao,im pretty into it,140 episodes in 2 weeks is pretty decent,especially considering i don't think I've ever enjoyed a show with a pace this slow,and with so little action,Well, in my defense, I didn't want to watch the arlong park arc so I watched a movie of it, which was more like 20% fighting,and the 20% was fuckin fire,im saying, I haven't seen the arc,so I can't say my opinion on it,I also won't ever watch it,Cus I got the plot out of it that I needed to,ty based plot,u don't need reasons, if you've watched the show and u read what jeff says about being able to tell the difference in the characters from start to finish in terms of strength, maturity, decision making, and interaction with other characters, you'd simply agree.,if you've done all those things and still don't see the development,nothing I say or do will make u see it,since ur blind,that's how it works,Trynd - Today at 12:59 AM
If you watched romcom animes
you would know
how little depth the characters have and how they are the furthest thing from unique you can find in anime,klerny as far as im concerned if you can't speak english you have no place in an argument being held in the english language,much like if you enjoy romance anime, you hold no place in any discussion about anime,cus ur just dumb and wrong,explained why,extensively,scroll up and read again,im saying,"i've watched both shows","the difference is clear and apparent",there needs to be no further argument,use your eyes,they're the opinions of everyone i've ever spoken to about this who are males that aren't averse or nyy,which sounds really specific, but considering how many people i've spoken to about this,not at all,well, you're simply wrong,If you wanna go down this route,I can give you the good ol' "I'm worth more than you in every single conceivable way, so your opinion is worthless" schpiel again,but I was trying to give you the benefit of the doubt.,me and jeff are peers of one another,after review,romcom is trash,hajime no ippo is 🔥,why?,have u watched the show?,that's the only response necessary,Trynd - Today at 1:00 AM

if you look at dbz which has a ton of episodes as well and you look at one piece you can clearly see the difference in character development even though they are the same genre,as long as I watch anime and have opinions that are so strong there's no way anyone could logically disagree with them, there's only 2 outcomes,1. I'm objectively right,2. I'm subjectively right, but the people who disagree are idiots.,That's this situation.,not necessary,i've watched the shows myself,I don't need to logically explain that they're shit,u watch season 8 of the walking dead compared to season 2 and it's shit,Why is it shit? look at the screen,and observe it being shit,it doesn't make me look stupid at all,there's no possible way you could disagree with me and be in anything but the underwhelming minority,i suppose you're entitled to your stupid, wrong, worthless opinion.,Do you want an objective argument?,One piece is the best selling manga/anime of all time and has gotten 1st place for 4 years straight.,No further argument necessary,people agree with me, they don't agree with you.,So you're wrong.,if the majority thinks one thing is better than another thing in overwhelming numbers,it is.,Even if you can rationalize that it isn't somehow,it still is,im talking the absolute majority btw,that being ALL people who consume/watch anime/manga,not like "a lot of people like attack on titan, so it's good",so many people like one piece it can't be anything but amazing,this can't be said for any romcom,literally ANY romcom,People who don't like fighting like one piece,people who don't like slower paced shows (like myself) and prefer shonen like one piece.,People who normally watch romance anime (nyy) have watched the entirety of one piece and read most of the manga,is this a coincidence? of course it isn't,it's a good show,end of discussion,Trynd - Today at 1:07 AM
i literally made the point just now that terms of strength isn't character development, precisely the point of comparing dbz and one piece, both progress immensely in strength but its easy to see how dbz lacks in character development of any kind
but arguing with someone who can't see the character development in one piece isn't worth arguing with as its like talking to a silver league player with 20000 games played
they have a lot of experience but their brain can't grasp any of it
can he name a romance anime that has character development better than OP,what do u mean?,his opinions are my opinions verbatem,i don't disagree with a word he says regarding anything about anime. Not because I'm meatriding him or anything, but he's the guy who originally got me into anime and he's recommended to me every show that's in my top 10. He happens to know my taste and opinions quite well,and his are pretty similar,he's watched one piece and i haven't, so u get his opinions on it,correct,if enough people have an opinion, it is right,and anyone who disagrees is wrong/ignorant,Let me actually add an asterisk,if enough people have an opinion THAT CAN'T BE STATISTICALLY PROVEN WRONG,it's right,because most people think it's right,pretty simple logic to follow,if the majority says "half the black people i've met have been violent" but a study shows it's like 3%. The popular opinion is wrong according to math and it's a common misconception or something.,But if everyone on earth likes one piece and you say "romcom is better than one piece",YOU'RE the one who needs to explain why,not the other way around,because most people disagree with you,as i said,it's been mathematically proven false.,Common misconception.,I'm too smart to ever be wrong,pls,,literally me in this conversation,cus it's for romcom loving weeb trash?,like averse and u,i don't use it, jeff doesn't,u and averse do,IE: it's for weebtrash,demographics make up a large majority of any survey,the reason my majoriy thing makes sense and yours doesn't for MAL,is because MAL is a select group,"top sales" is literally everyone,literally everyone who has ever watched or enjoyed anime,ever.,it's been top sales for years,And it's like,over twice as much as 2nd place,There's a difference between being a slight 1st place,and selling 20 million copies when 2nd is 6 million,one piece blows everything else out,and has for ever,are you the dumbest person to ever live?,use google,use GOOGLE,dumbfuck,i've already seen the surveys,and have no reason to look up something i already looked up,?,you're the one who doesn't believe the majority,so again, you prove me wrong,not the other way around,my opinion is correct until proven incorrect.,which can't be done,ittai mega,usa usa usa,for justice,J U S T I C E,shit's pretty fucked,Is that a good thing?,here's the thing, it should at least be more fun for us the pros,but do you think it'll be more fun for the average joe?,like, there's NO WAY anyone at top level would be mad about these changes unless they're terribly executed,that said, there IS a reason blc failed. Whether it's the gameplay or not isn't for us to say,but im worried, i'll admit,who knows, i hope it's not a situation where i love the changes and every viewer/redditor/gold player despises them,it's the worst case scenario,as much as i hate to say it, if that's the case, I hope SLS has the sense to revert the changes.,Even if it's less fun for us, the game's commercial success is more important for now until the community is stable,then they can fuck around with more experimental shit that may be great or terrible,just my 2 cents tho,well, i talked to jeff who's a longtime friend of mine and he said he tried blc for a few weeks and he described the problems as "the game feeling clunky and overcomplicated, the art being weird and offputting, and in general the graphics being so bad it was hard to tell what was going on",and as someone who hasn't played it and has only watched it, I can see where he's coming from,even as a BR player i have pretty much NO clue what's going on,Yeah, I didn't.,A game based off of another game will never achieve a huge commercial level of success.,...He said, thinking about battlerite,<:thinkingHard:286475911283474434>,well, they're totally different games,with the same core concepts,so people who play one can play the other,but they're far from the same game,i guess that's true,i wasn't saying BLC is a wow arena clone or something stupid like that,just that a game that's basically a niche version of an already relatively niche title,is UNLIKELY to be huge,without you know, riot's 300 billion dollar chinese overlord funding,from my understanding, most people I knew who tried the game simply thought that the game was clunky and they absolutely hated the aesthetic, so they didn't give it a fair chance.,They probably never reached the depth in the first place.,It's the exact opposite problem BR has, where the game seems great at first, but the deeper into the water you go the worse it becomes,they need to strike a middle ground where it grabs your attention right away (something it's already capable of doing) but it has the longevity and depth of BLC,i hate to say it, but maybe a more generic UI/interface/aesthetic update/overhaul was all the game needed,i don't know, like i said it isn't for us to say,but a game that looks like BR and plays like BLC (without the gay walling characters like thorn with no outplay mechanics. aka m1's in battlerite) and medallions and traits and all this other shit,i mean, what's not to like?,they just need to make the game somewhere inbetween BR and BLC's skillcap, improve on the aesthetic aspect of the game, release more champions and DON'T add any stupid gimmicky cancer to play against shit,like fucking PEARL,no more PEARL,i dont mean characters, i meant individual moves,i should elaborate more clearly,shifu's incap, oldur pet, thorn wall,that shit is fucking gay,and EVERYONE hates it,except the guy doing it,idk LUL,i didnt play game,looked hella gay 2 me tho,neewha?,Pogc- oh,ily joltz,yeah. I'd rather see battlerite succeed than have the perfect high level game we all want,at the end of the day, top players play the hand they're dealt. we all only want such a high skillcap intense game because we ALL think we're the best and that's the easiest way to prove it consistently. A game where skill is the only factor that determines who wins and where mistakes are constant.,But even if the game's easy, the top players find a way to consistently win. It's just harder.,i agree with that,hope the mongoloids do too,katey's posts dude,"where should i go for my july vacation?" with a poll,im tempted to be like,"havent you had enough vacations for one year already?",3 vacations in 6 months,and her "work" is on UI and... dev blogs and twitter and reddit shitposting,<:thinkin:277316223791005697>,https://www.reddit.com/r/BattleRite/comments/5zzrxk/psa_if_you_complain_about_shifu_you_suck_ass/,what a time to be alive,he better,shit champ,it's been a pain in my ass to play him for like 3 months at least,ever since jumong was the best in the game,shifu's been weak,there's been some hilariously broken ranged that directly counters him every patch,first jumong, then taya, now back to jumong again,and ashka too,oh i know,it'll be how it's always been,easier for shifu than any other melee,but still terrible,supports/ranged destroy melee,it's how the game is made.,good,i'll finally convince my team to let me main him,any raigon buffs?,i'd rather main raigon,lame.,we can talk about buffs l8r,i gotta go driving,driving swag,...what,?,alright,for my entire time driving,i didn't look in my blind spot OR use my turn signal a single time,legend,die a legend,all i do is learn to drive,against my will,need to just bike everywhere,and then crush watermelons with my quads,lmao someone hit me up cause i was streaming solo queue yesterday,ran into wuzac, blanks, nikita,i think u guys were just sniping me for fun,but someone messaged me and was like "what's with all the EU guys in NA queue?",i was like "they probably think it's easier to move up than EU queue even with 150 ping","and they're probably right",<:LUL:269941798107873286>,NGL playing against u guys in NA queue is a dream come true,u guys are good practice cause u use your escapes well,but like, the games are free wins,since u can't deal with my counters,it's so troll,makunouchi,I P P O,i been back,but thx,EU,cucks,i have invented,Z O O M T E C H,the ultimate BR dick length enhancer,it's the sickest EVER,zoom tech is too lit,to quit,klerny,i appreciate ur leaking,but ur going on so many incoherant rambling tangents i can't really make out what any of the changes are,can u sum them up for me?,basic champ changes,i heard shifu was being buffed?,i've been lied to by commie scum?,just played rivals of aether for the first time since like a week after it released,turns out,im fucking sick at that game,forgot i was #1 forsburn world,and i*,OwO,i'll be 21 by the time there's LAN,\o/,my 10th grade math teacher was doing his 1st or 2nd year teaching ever,dude was like, 23 or 24,fresh outta college,i went to like a top 2 or 3 school in the state too,everyone tried to be homies with him,and he was actually SUCH a hardass,cus he had to like, do the opposite since everyone assumed he'd be hella laid back and chill,dont blame the guy, it was his first year on the job, gotta show he's serious,so he doesn't get fired instantly,he was suuuuuuuch a dick tho,i added him on xbox live,and bopped him in mw2,true story,i was born when the faith in humanity died,...Coincidence,:^),mfw people are 11 years older than me,mfw neewha is literally double ninjas' age,mfw time is crazy,mulk,do you think you have as much knowledge and wisdom and experience as 2.3 ninjas' combined,?,wow,teach me the way,so i can pass it onto my son ninjas,ok,ty sensei,>wise,>megumin,ULU,tfw ur in the middle,too old to be ninjas, too young to be finnish math sex god,feels bad man,did u guys know,i 1v1'd ninjas' shifu yesterday,and he beat my ass,feels prodigal son man,tfw u arent the 14 year old savior of mankind,me too thanks,also, i thought about it a lot,technically,we're all our own dog,woof,woof,YOU'RE IN THE HOUSE OF GOD BABY <:PogChamp:282891715810033665>,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SCb1eamm-M,ppmd's combos are so,FILTHY,i wanna throw up,"hear you're pretty good at that smash bros game","I'm alright" -

Whatever.,It actually almost never varies.,The strongest champs are the strongest in all situations.,Poloma, jumong, ashka, croak, varesh, oldur,destroy everyone else,in every situation,1v1, 2v2, 3v3, whatever,damage, mid control, cc, combo abilities, mobility, etc,they just win in every aspect,jumong is the #1 champ in the game right now,period,in all game modes,poloma is 2nd,ashka's probably 3rd,varesh 4th,i could list them all in order if u want,actually, thinking about it.

I forgot 2 apparently but idk,Something like that.,There ya' go,best chars in the game,in order,objectively,lucie's garbage,unplayable,Bakko's stronger than shifu by a ton,iva is too,shifu's needed a buff since before the last nerf,idk how many times i have to repeat myself,ya ashka's actually like,1st,im just sick of poloma,Ashka is hilariously strong given that it's impossible to make a mistake on him.,He plays the same flowchart every game and he's anti range, anti melee, super combo heavy, best escapes in the game straight up, 1st highest ranged dps, good mid control, decent cc,pretty much no weakness at all,the weakness of ashka is the people playing him,that's all it is.,well that's more of a bo9 tournament thing,and isn't used that often,on it's own,but it does exist,croak can't be first retard,ranged and supports destroy every melee,they always have,croak is the strongest melee, but he's still 5th at best,croak is as strong as shifu and bakko combined into one champion,and he's still 5th,glad u understand,actually croak is like,bakko shifu and a second shifu in one champion,and he's still 5th,ya jade's pretty awful,she's broken with croak,but that's cause he's croak,not cause she's jade,1.

I really don't,so shifu getting another nerf is brutal,like actually SO brutal,<@158305555037945856> bakko's the 2nd strongest melee. And the best melee with varesh/poloma in 3's.,What are you talking about?,You're implying he isn't good in 3's,im telling you he's insane,even the "isn't good on his own" part is wrong,he crushes shifu 1v1,and shifu is the 1v1 king,especially against melees,there's nobody in NA that can beat me with bakko, retard.,It doesn't change the fact.,Facts are facts.,no bakko player in NA can beat me because im me,bakko is insane.,croak works in literally any comp though,and against literally any comp,that's the definition of strong,randler,ur below me,kneel,OwO,i broke his brain,eu people are too simple man,my b,LUL,he went "BAKKO IS BETTER THAN SHIFU?","RRRRRRRREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE",rip EU,you mean before everything shifu was weak against got buffed and he got nerfed twice?,yeah that was fun,You're the one who can't read randler. I told you that list is based on the entire game.,Bakko is better than shifu in every single situation possible.,In 1v1, in 2v2, in 3v3, with or against any comp.,Bakko is always better.,Is that more clear?,You must be joking.,Not only have I never lost a single tournament, and am the only person on earth with that title,but im also the ONLY shifu player on earth,for at least 2 months,i beat nikita 1v1 with my raigon.,What's your point?,ya, on EU ping,after i 5-0'd him 3 times on NA ping,did he leave that part out?,then it's pointless to discuss it,melee 1v1's can't be done on high ping. It was proven forever ago when I played against corrupted.,You simply can't flick from people's Q's, lose orbs, and get ulted.,It doesn't really matter the matchup.,so why talk about it?,and he is,1 shifu player globally in the top 16 teams of enter the arena,wasn't condemned,or corrupted,sorry,shifu's been trash for a long, long time,i carry the champ.,because i love the S P E A R,<@208693717563998209> what other form could jesus possibly take,sounds like a god to me,i see, i had to scroll up,so ur telling me condemned beats nikita?,impossible,i don't believe it,you got proof?,^,As i said.,condemned can't beat nikita.,There's too large of a skillgap,even if the matchup DID favor shifu,which honestly 1v1, it's like 55:45,shifu wins,but it's damn close,remember when shifu bakko was like 80:20?,you could just m1 m1 m1 m2 him,over and over forever,and never die,shit was siiiiick,As of right now, im the 2nd best shifu on earth,and the 3rd best player.,"teldo",KEK,well, that's why we're all waiting for the 23rd right?,if i'm really 6th best, you'll see it then.,spoiler: you won't.,idk,hansa decided to say im 6th best completely out of the blue,cus he has beef,for some reason,I said im the 2nd best shifu. 3rd best player in the world.,player as in any character.,Ninjas.,Ninjas <:PogChamp:282891715810033665>,well, lucky of ninjas i saw he was talented when he was grade 10,played with him nonstop every day for 1500 games,we improved together,he's better than i am now,but it's not as if he got there by himself,dude it's actually crazy,i played with ninjas and was like,"this guy is so good wtf","grade 10?",i asked him who's smurf he was,probably 30 times,literally 30 times,and he was like "im not a smurf",every time,was so dumbfounded,Ninjas could beat anyone here on their main champion.,He's a monster.,Ninjas had a 95% rook winrate, his jumong beats averse's in solo queue, his shifu beats mine 1v1, his sirius is a higher level than anyone else on any character by miles,i dont think people will catch up to him ever,95% solo queue,are u shitting me,it was like his 3rd best champ,95%,with like 200 games,wtf,shit dude,1v1 ninjas,i'd love to watch ninjas 1v1 the EU guys on fair ping,but it can't happen,it's sad,im not suggesting anything,im just saying, ninjas doesn't lose,the circumstances don't really matter,weirdly the only time he loses is in tournament when im not there,no idea why,cus i actually dont do anything,except run in circles and incap,since shifu can't do anything else,0 sustain 0 damage 0 iframes,literally JUST runs around,and incaps,and gets mid and ults,lively eh?,shifu 4th best melee in a meta where supports and ranged both dominate melee,what a time to be alive,AND he's nerfed substantially in a week,i wonder if they're really gonna make him so unviable that i drop him,i dont want to drop shifu,im the only guy who still plays him,like, anywhere,lol,i havent seen a shifu in solo queue in like,a week and a half,LUL,well anyway i like talking to u guys,u dont have to be so hostile,the only shifu on my stream yesterday was ninjas,cus we 1v1'd for like 3 hours,hansa, klerny, a couple others,most of u guys are cool,that was sarcasm...,...,i was like "finally a champ shifu can do decent against","shifu","shifu hard counters shifu","great MU",ya,ninjas does whatever the fuck he wants,he can't lose,he has like 20 raigon games,he's the way averse was like 3 months ago honestly,don't see anyone beating him unless they put in like 10 hours a day for like 4 weeks.,Cause that's how ninjas passed me and averse,we both got kinda lazy,ninjas played EVERY day,nah, it's not surprising,ninjas is just a monster,and to be fair, he only plays sirius in tournaments and 2's queue now,solo queue is only jumong/shifu,we actually had a conversation last night about how shifu's terrible in solo queue,he was like "yeah it really sucks a lot",feels shifu man,i just want my rank 2,zzzzzz,gotta re-learn my jumong,cause shifu can't get the job done,can't,jumong is on both teams in every game,jumong rapes croak,much like he rapes literally everything except jumong,i even think he beats ashka 1v1,all EU lists,i promise you, jumong is literally a 50% pickrate right now,in NA,he's everywhere,every game, both teams,averse and ninjas both noticed it too,he's E V E R Y W H E R E,i didn't really get it, didn't think he was that good. Until I tried to play nerfed shifu against it,holy fuck he's broken as hell,well, jumong's the best solo queue hero,and i think he's the best 2's hero in general,he's at least high tier in 3v3 as

Ninjas will follow me to the end of the earth,We'll always be on the same team,I love ninjas,Ninjas <:PogChamp:282891715810033665>,O pls everyone loves ninjas,Hes the little bro of battlerite,Hes TOO sick,Ninjas is a homie,He wouldnt turn his back on me,Me and ninjas have god synergy,Me and ninjas can win without and against averse. We've played together from the start.,He probably would have better results with me.,Well. Im the strongest melee. Ninjas is the strongest support. Averse is the strongest ranged. Any 2 of us could pick up any other player who cares about winning,Thats the honest to god truth,Swah,G,Kill,Turtle,Jesus christ this fuckin kid,I talk to ninjas about what a fuckin idiot averse is and ninjas begs me to make amends,So i write this big fuckin ridiculous genuine apology for this stupid motherfucker and what do i get,Fuckin nada. Nothing.,Prick blocks me on discord says never to speak to him again,I mean really im over here getting my balls busted 24/7 in every possible situation and he's as sensitive as a fuckin girl if i even complain about him to anyone else,And of course nobody on this earth is fuckin trustworthy enough for me to even bitch about him without him knowing. No fuckin loyalty,Now i gotta talk to my fucking sponsor about what we do about him,Since he cant control his fuckin emotions and put on a fake smile like every other adult male on the fucking planet,Jesus fucking christ how did i get saddled with such a needy fucking bitch,No rifle you dont,Well actually you do,Im in a contract,And you're in a contract. For life.,Have fun with that,I am a man,You fuckin shitting me? I already did that,I was the bigger man,I said it already. Big apology. Accepted responsibility for shit that wasnt my fault and only harmed me. Begged this fuck for forgiveness for the sake of ninjas,And what does he do? He spits in my fuckin face,Oh averse responded xaynox,With "after seeing what you say behind my back i'd rather you never speak to me again" and then blocking me,The worst i've said about him is that he cries like a fuckin woman,Which hes still currently doing,Its not like i said i'd kick his ass or his mother is a cunt or he sucks at the game or something,Kid is a fuckin whiner,Thats all,Fuck him,Fuck him, his mother, everything he stands for,Fuck averse,We've had problems since way before that,You dont need the details of it but basically we both treat eachother like shit,And a specific event happened recently that really pushed it over the edge,And we cant fuckin stand eachother now,I dont even wanna be in the same room as that two faced crybaby prick,He wants to get into it with me? I'll make sure this damage is never undone,I dont give a fuck what he says or does. Fuck him.,I mean really guys. Am i in the fucking wrong here?,I even reached out to him with an apology and he's gonna smack me in the face? At some point i've gotta stand my ground and tell him he's a fuck,Im not perfect but im doing what i can,What does this guy expect?,The situation is too complicated to explain.,It would take me 3 days of nonstop typing,Him.,How many times have i told you im the captain.,Nah. Whoever we can find.,Matter of fact i might just quit and let him and ninjas play,Make ninjas the new captain and wash my hands of this shit,And it wont be a replacement by onslaught.,Im talkin to onslaught now,Wonder what they'll say about all this,Well i explained the whole situation to the co founder of onslaught,So once she gets through the 8 pages of text we'll see the verdict,Hatred of averse via a combination of factors including vastly different opinions personalities and values, jealousy, and spite,That got pushed over the edge when a girl i liked chose him over me,And i actually blew a gasket at him,Way beyond repair,Isnt like that verosk,I didnt like her like some horny teenager internet retard,She meant something to me,Anyway im not getting into this,Point is thats the tldr and shit is mega fucked,She blocked me, he blocked me, i told him to go fuck his own mother,The rest is history,Well its over now,But you guys know the tension has been between me and averse for months,You'd have to be retarded to have not noticed,Jeffy best croak world's return,2k17,Diary of Jade <:PogChamp:282891715810033665>,Gf has been rip,For forever,Why am i even arguing with you about this,I dont care what you think the credability of my story is,I wouldnt be in this fuckin position if the story wasnt the truth,Just forget it dude.,What am i gonna do about averse,I dont know if there's even anything i can do now,I dont have a choice,I have a team,I have a contract,Ninjas begged me to keep the fuckin team together,Because he doesnt want to leave either of us,If ninjas had to choose someone he's choose me,But i dont want to make him have to choose,If averse wouldve just accepted my fuckin apology,Or if i had just not yelled at him to begin with,We're actually both so stupid,NA brain lag,Yeah yeah meme it up,Eurofucks,I only even say this shit cause i like you slimeball fucks,I told you,It isnt like that,I dont even know what the fuck she looks like,Its about her personality,I've never met someone i felt like i connected with more than her,I come to find out randomly,"I've been dating averse since last week",You WHAT,and here we are,Dating,Dont think she does.,Edating shit.,I dunno the situation. I didnt ask. Isnt my fuckin business.,My assumption is edating.,Would i destroy my own team and friendship for no reason if i wasnt?,What am i supposed to do,Yeah. I got it already.,Im literally the toughest exterior person you've ever met,This is probably the only time ive talked about feelings in the last 10 years,Dont give me that man up shit,Cant keep it up forever,Oh what the fuck is this dr phil,You sound like fuckin averse,Sure. If you wanna confess your feelings to the woman you love because it makes you feel better to vent or something,I get it. Thats manly,Nobody else EVER finds out about that shit tho,Theres a difference between what happens in the walls of your own home and with basically strangers,Theres no love, you just get labeled a bitch and get the piss taken out of you,Thats how i was raised,And thats whats happening here except for you,So what the fuck are you talkin about,^,<:PogChamp:282891715810033665> BLC,Nah.,Shes the best female player i think though. Anywhere.,Might be wrong,Nah,ROFL,HAFU,verosk she isnt competitive persay,She just cant engage in physical activies as much as others because of a rare disability she has that you'd never know she has but she does.,Exactly like me,Like i said, she really clicks with me in ways nobody else does,But i guess she doesnt see.it,What can ya do,It aint about edating. That shit makes me cringe,Shes a nice girl who has a billion life experiences and qualities i have that i've never seen in anyone else,It was actually trippy. Blew my mind,I wouldnt care,I dont want to fuck her you nit,I just have never met a girl who's so much like me,Actually, saying that and thinking about averse dating her,Ugh man what the fuck,That rat fuck,Well you see the ways her and i are similar are really niche and rare. But there's a ton of them. So we arent really the same personality wise or anything like that, and nobody would even know about the similarities we have because so few friendships even go into that much detail about people's personal lives,It isnt something i expect you guys to understand,No you nit im fuckin serious,I'd list examples but it isnt even shit i can go in depth about because its the kind of shit only her and my fuckin family know about,And we're the same in shit like that. A different way of having to live and act nobody else understands,We actually are similar. This isnt some blinded by love shit,I just dont get it. I mean sure, dont like me, im an asshole. Whatever. I had accepted that and was fine with it,But to not like me and to like averse?,Are you fucking kidding me,Verosk no,I've never felt this way about anyone as far as i can remember.,Literally nobody.,Except maylon.,If the similarities stopped at gamer or little personal quirks, i wouldnt care enough to tear one of my best friends and teammate a new asshole for 2 weeks straight over it,Its different im tellin you,Whether you believe me or not is whatever,Wouldnt care,I'd take a bullet for that chick,And shes with fuckin averse,I mean what the fuck,Averse no respect for the fuckin brocode,Yes,I dont care what she looks like,I dont care if she's fuckin igor,With how her personality is,Im all in,Well none of this shit matters anyway,But thats the beef with averse,Shit is fucked,But also you can see from my pov,How the fuck can i be teammates with him now,Thats some actual cucking shit,Just scroll nyy,Leaving the team?,Im kicking averse out forcefully,My fuckin team,Well we had lots of problems before this chick even existed,But its just another drop in the bucket,Had enough,My goddamn internet is still out too,Just wanna try new patch,Zzzzzz,Nah. She told me from the start she wasnt interested,Like i said thats expected and doesnt bother me. I carry myself a certain way for a reason and it has repurcussions,But the way i carry myself is way better than averse,You fuckin kidding me,Italian genetics kick the shit out of asians. Are you kidding me?,The thought of them dating is actually cringey in a sort of edating watching romcoms together actual gross kind of way,Cus i know i could have a real relationship but what the fuck can i do,She made a decision, wrong fuckin decision,U guys are fam,Mistake cant be made,She blocked me and is dating averse. Who also blocked me.,The only mistake i could make was already made loud and clear,When i told averse to go fuck himself for 2 weeks straight.,I told onslaught and they go,"You mightve been too hard on averse",Gotta be shitting me,With this shit,I met verosk online and now he's living with me <:PogChamp:282891715810033665>,No,That was cause i was on my dads pc,Was mad gay,Exactly wing,Thats how its supposed to be,The only emotion you ever see from a man is anger,Because its the only one you need to vent,The rest of them you can keep to yourself,Misinformed by my own life experience?,I've been that way my whole life,My old man, his old man, my step dad and mom's boyfriend. They're mens men,The type im talking about,The strong silent type,You mean a bitch,Like averse,Averse is so emotional if i tell him to shut up he leaves his room for a halfhour to sit outside alone so he can vent his sadness properly,Im not shitting you,He really does this shit,I shit talked him to his fuckin face,He blocked me,Did you miss it?,I've been calling him a miserable pussy punk bitch for weeks,Well. He didnt block me. We just have no mutual servers. Same with the chick.,They just deleted me,Please. I let my emotions take over and ruin my team over a 12 year old.,Really? Name them.,Like a 12 year old,Not over,I left battlerekt,Left prorl,Is he?,O,Then he has me blocked?,I wish i could take screenshot on phone,Thinking,Idk how 2 phone,Very bad at it,Your message could not be delivered because you don't share a server with the recipient or you disabled direct messages on your shared server, recipient is only accepting direct messages from friends, or you were blocked by the recipient.,Etc.,Dont bother.,Onslaught is trying to save the team,Look even if they convince him to talk to me what am i supposed to do? Get cucked?,Apologize and pretend shit is cool for the team?,Dude ninjas is like,So old and so young,He like doesnt have any life experience. But intelligence wise its like talking to my dad,He just has no foresight,U dont get it verosk,Ninjas said he'll play with me if the team breaks up,But he doesnt think this is worth breaking up over,He was like "yeah it sucks for you but like... We win every tournament",Not anymore,Now what,Ninjas is <:feelsSomethingman:285783203913138187> irl,Face cracks me up,Its so good,How am i gonna grab my balls as a disrespectful gesture with no balls?,Think a little,Im not about the dead ball life,I have more testosterone in my toenail than averse does in his whole body,Cause i have to deal with him day in and day out,You dont know what its like,Yeah well,Whats done is done,Yeah cool people. And klerny.,...and iska.,<:feelsSomethingman:285783203913138187>,All averse does is constantly try to police everything i say and do because im "too controversial" and i get him hate and he has to deal with drama and blah blah blah,Everything is about him and hes such a fuckin whiner dude,You have no idea,Averse was a good friend of mine until a few weeks ago,There's a part of me that likes him,It certainly isnt the majority though,Up to about mid shaft actually,Mid*,Nice autocorrect,<:LUL:269941798107873286>,<:feelsSomethingman:285783203913138187>,K i d s h i f t,Actually no,I told i wasnt trying to ebone this chick,I really wasnt,Edating isnt my cup of tea,I was fine not dating her, averse was where my issue was,Minitown on boat <:PogChamp:282891715810033665>,Napping on boat <:PogChamp:282891715810033665>,Can i be darth maul,Ninjas actually def gets to be marth daul,Nice,Because its the principle of her not wanting to date me but wanting to date averse,The very concept of me being less appealing to a chick in any way is baffling, but especially one i feel so close to,Its the principle,Picking averse over me is like picking america cheese over mozzarella,What are you fucking nuts,Thats the other thing,Averse aint that good looking,Where is this appeal,Is she really that much of a fuckin weeb,Just wants some pussy to cry at romcom anime with her,Are you shitting me,Where is the SUBSTANCE,Nyy deals heroin to slumdogs like that polish croak fuck,Rofl,Kensu,I just mean kensu in general,He asked misterpink like 3 times to host him,At like 5 am,And misterpink was super reluctant but also tired and nobody else was on,Got the phat 80 viewer host during arakune leak night,Kensu <:LUL:269941798107873286>,<:feelsSomethingman:285783203913138187>,Wut,Jeffy was 2nd best,Rip jeffy,Apparently my sponsor reached out to our hard headed friend,And he isnt receptive whatsoever,Him and his fuckin girlfriend are convinced they dont need anyone but eachother and they're gonna tell anyone who disagrees to fuck off,This bitch really fucked everything up,She's got averse brainwashed. Im sure she's telling him "you dont need to accept their apology, you're better anyway, fuck them.",She's sucked this poor low self esteem huge ego son of a bitch in and she's making it worse,When averse told me he was sick of the shit i said behind his back, i knew right away he was talking about this chick. I mean she was really a good friend, i told her i was 100% honest with her aboit everything and i really was. I cant believe she'd take me blowing off some steam venting about averse right to the fuckin source and rat on me to make her chances of dating him better,Total bitch,I mean who the fuck steps inbetween an unbeatable team for their own selfish fuckin intentions?,Its not even averse,Its this chick,Suck my flu,Nyy how are you gonna sit here and defend averse,When the fuck do i lie about anything,You know im honest with you euro fucks,Always have been,I mean if im telling the truth, im not wrong right?,Thats all i wanna hear from you,Means it was incorrect,So on a lighter subject,How is shifu now?,The changes looked... Interesting on paper. A lot of good a lot of horrible,I thought overall hed be a bit better,Still not top tier or nothin,It is worth it nyy,All 3 of us agree on that.,You may not, but onslaught does,I know that much,He didnt leave. I insulted him and his girlfriend until they fuckin blocked me,And i told him on his own stream in the prl tourney he was getting benched,Told him it was his 3 month notice,He left because i made it 100% clear he wasnt welcome anymore,Not cause he just got mad and decided to,Only i make rash decisions like that,Ceo of onslaught reached out to him. Said it doesnt look good,I said. "So whats the procedure for replacing him then?",No response,Zzzz,The personal quarrels matter less than winning. I'd still play with him,Doesnt mean im gonna pretend to like him.,Which i did anyway on wednesday by the way,Wasnt at my home computer,I could beat every one of you eu cocksuckers by myself if i was on my own pc like i always do,Dont flatter yourself.,With or without averse it wont happen again,Theres only 1 thing i dont do,And thats lose,A construction worker wont cut my fios cable in half again,So i wont lose again,Whats so hard to understand?,I didnt remove him by force or bench him. I said once the contract was over he was gone.,He couldnt take being insulted constantly and left on his own,Good riddance,No. The girl killed the team.,Im just the guy who carried it out.,Bewz dont talk cause i dont know who the fuck you are,Appreciate it,She was mad at herself if its any consolation,It isnt.,Klerny made a post?,Link?,Found it,Yours,verosk,Rofl,Man im reading reddit,Every post is jumong ashka jade unbelievably broken.

With half the dps of jade.,Im speechless,Actually speechless,Dude,People thought melee was op?,Who?

It's over.,Don't talk about it anymore.,me and averse are good,don't wanna talk about it,oh wait,thought u meant averse,holy shit im tripping balls,yeah idk shifu,he's just...,...,i can't even put into words,what makes him so bad,no damage, no healing, no cc for rotating in and out,basically comes down to that,he's not good enough in any field and he's definitely an "all around" type champ. Someone who will always be too strong or too weak,but he's pathetically weak,uh, i made averse suicidal by being a complete dick, felt really bad and apologized and he forgave me,that's the short version,it's more complex than that tho,we're good,ya,same deal,,shifu is lookin,PRETTY buffed to me,like this EVERY game,with every rite build,SEEMS,LEGIT,TO ME,im literally,1-17 with shifu,SEEMS,BROKE,im like,10-1 with croak,lol,he wasn't fair before,he was dogshit even then,now he's a disgrace to game designers everywhere,well unfortunately,if you make the only 2 chars in the game who are cool shit at the same time,game dies,shifu's HORRIBLE rn,so croak has to stay broken until they fix him,hard life,oWo,he isnt cool tho,lenny ramming a wall.copypasta,Nikita <:PogChamp:282891715810033665>,nikita,i lov u,lov,http://i.imgur.com/aIaFk.gif?noredirect,rogue dps,PogChamp,faggot wotlk DK build,PogChamp,>survival game,>im 12 btw haHAA,rofl,no tag me nikita,bad nikita,bad,me like card,me like rng,ruh,TOSS MASTER RACE <:PogChamp:282891715810033665>,D E A T H B A L L,zealot archon <:PogChamp:282891715810033665>,blink stalker micro <:PogChamp:282891715810033665>,when u almost get a royal flush with 1 card,but the river is a 5 of clubs instead of a jack of clubs,feels only nut flush man,<:PogChamp:282891715810033665> //,competitive region,That being said I feel like the new patch is a major nerf to the ranged champions. I've tried it out on jumong, jade, and varesh, and they all feel so weak. Yes their damage has been buffed but now any melee champ who knows what they're doing just does a little strafing dance and I actually can't hit them. Upon watching replays of myself I saw that they seemed to be dodging the ranged m1s on reaction, even the ones that I led to account for their dodge.
After trying the ranged champs and doing awfully, I jumped onto shifu and started doing the regular dodge and shimmy and I felt untouchable. I felt even more powerful than shifu back in season 0 before the nerfs, and i didn't lose a single match.,..........,.............,???????? help me?,my sponsor was like "stop getting in arguments on reddit, it's making u look bad",so im staying out of this one,but LOL,nah dude he said he was HIGH DIAMOND,by NO MEANS COMPETITIVE,every range is somewhere between decent and ungodly broken,there's no exception,even iva's alright,compare iva to the new shifu or bakko,fucking rip,i gotta say though, for a patch that did nothing but buffs ranged,i can't BELIEVE how strong croak is,he beats them 1v1,somehow,croak actually just walks up to jumon,and destroys him,through his 18 damage autos,like what the hell,can't hit what u can't see,OwO,well shifu is still by far the worst champ on this patch,iva's pretty bad too,i went like 1-17 on shifu in ranked,i had multiple rounds against plats,where i got under 50 score,i was gonna say, raigon is strong as fuck now,yeah i have fizz,havent gotten over 200 score one round,against anybody,lol,any comp, any players,yeah that's his strat now, you space right at the start of the round into an early R and combo someone for half their hp before they get energy to dodge,but then you don't do anything for 12 full seconds,so u just die,no healing, no mobility, no iframes,just die,well unfortunately the snare round 2 doesn't do anything now,since u lose melee trades,u need to take the Q one even tho it's nerfed,just for running,i mean, to be honest with you, he's so bad it's pointless to even discuss,i was the only person left playing him and now i don't play him either,so we just wait for buffs,so lol,there's only 1 interesting thing about him,his round 1 space rite gives energy even when you exspace, and because of the global cooldown removal if you're like frame perfect you can sometimes i think (I've only done it once in about 20 games) get 3 autos during space instead of 2,which is a huge deal,but it isn't practical and doesn't help enough considering how shit he is,raigon and shifu have the same problem, their kit is too strong and their numbers are too weak,if you increase the numbers you get a 1v3ing god,if you don't, you get shifu this patch,he can't ever be balanced,well unfortunately,council works for teldo,so rip,actually all of SLS work for teldo,as do all humans,on earth,we must worship the chosen croak,i too am all about that croak life,im probably gonna play raigon in tournament,averse got instakilled in 3v3 yesterday and me and ninjas 2v3'd and won with my raigon,he was on pest tho,and pest is like,so disgusting i want to throw up,but i got like 1600 score or something,raigon is good, he's just really really hard,probably the highest apm char in the game,for the same results,raigon is actually like 100 apm,and his flick aim is tough,he reminds me a lot of sirius,like i can't play sirius because i can't do the ninjas™,where you aim banana at one guy to burn counter/space and then flick it into the other guy,over and over with every banana,yeah, pest is the #1 champ in the game,by an enormous margin,trickmasta made a new account,got to champ 5 without losing one game,smashed averse 100 times,in the process,fortunately, ninjas is good at pest,cus he's good at everything,so we're fine,we're probably gonna play croak/pest/ashka,or raigon/pest/jade,nah,we've always been at a huge disadvantage comp wise against them,and honestly, against every other team we've ever played,2 melees in a game made for ranged,pls,ninjas is unkillable,well, not ninjas,pest.,there's no way to kill pest on this patch,lol,every single round is either sudden death or you die,i've done 2k damage in one round and not killed him,he actually can't be killed,lol,ur a bad player,that's a quote straight from averse's mouth nikita,"pestilus can't be killed",ninjas agrees,and so do i,he is god,even if you have 3 champs combo him at once queen outheals it easily,he's god,if someone like TRICKMASTA,can win 50+ games in a row,against averse,in solo queue,the champ can't be beaten,especially given jumong was buffed,no, we've known trickmasta for like,8 months,at least,he's never stood a chance,i absolutely demolish him every game,everyone does,but he goes from 0% winrate to 100% instantly overnight?,seems convenient,when i say 100%, i mean 100% btw,he hasn't lost 1 game,0,100% winrate in solo queue,in champ,lol,from a mid level player,u must be joking,NA is the home of the 3 best players on earth,it isn't the reason,it's just pest,no, it isn't,because im saying it,ur too cocky,zzzz,pest cannot lose,cannot.,the only thing that can beat pest is another pest,what exaggeration? trickmasta ACTUALLY has 100% winrate,100%,100%,100%,what don't you get,ur 100% bad,he can space through walls,has 2 aoe panics,queen outheals all damage in the game,and bodyblocks at the same time,no it won't?,it's INVINCIBLE?,when you place it?,INVINCIBLE?,i haven't played against pest yet,but i have played with it,no? cus he spaces through walls,ranged can't follow him now,unless ur ashka,because ashka,his get out of jail free card is queen,it's gamebreakingly strong,it was even before the rework,who cares? he doesn't take any damage,you can ult him 5 times in one round and he's still alive,the character doesn't die,if we lose with pest it'll be to another pest,no other outcome is possible.,pest is god,he's a champ with no weakness to any other member of the entire cast,his toughest matchups are croak and ashka, which is true for literally every other champ in the game,but he still beats them both,badly,pest can practically kills ashka and croak 2v1,he's actually so insane,it makes no sense,he does more damage than them both combined,gets reaction panicked on space endlag,if you q before space he spaces,can space through walls,^,well, we figured it out,but it wasn't hard to figure out,as soon as you see trickmasta with 100% winrate,it's overwhelmingly clear,losing to a better pest with our brand new pest doesn't mean anything,then he'll lose,that's all.,the chance of winning vs pestilus without pestilus is 0%.,The same as jumong last patch.,or the same as croak in any patch,ya,mid tiers always have around 100% winrate,im not arguing with u,i agree,he could use a buff,LUL,also please remove all posts saying shifu is underpowered,teldo's direct orders,if you don't remove all posts saying shifu needs a buff,teldo will PERSONALLY show up at your house,and incap you,for the rest of your life,fanservice <:PogChamp:282891715810033665>,yeah forreal,how long is this anime,ROFL,FaceWut,does nyy have a screenshot of literally every scene with megumin in it,?,:nobully:,pro gamer genetics,right there,i actually have a conspiracy that teldo is some absurdly rich kid who stopped being a pro OW player to like, make battlerite, and SLS all work for him and subtley make his champ stronger and stronger until he's the best player on the world so he can look "pro",i think i've actually lost my mind,but wtf is croak,:frogchamp:,,first game,i get trickmasta's smurf on my team,he's higher elo than my main,MFW,pehbak and trickmasta are the 2 pests in NA,both rocking absurd winrates,wew,,that's why,they're bad,but my pest is worse,with his 99% winrate,what can i do,im only the 3rd best champ in the game against 2nd and 1st,tough game,well it was 100% yesterday,i asked him if he was still 100% winrate,and he said "no cus i injured my wrist",fucking LOL,ya bakko was broken,i agree,EU <:LUL:269941798107873286>,u see how easy it is to dismiss,thats what u look like 24/7,it was 100% at the time that averse had told me about his existence,which was yesterday,idk when he lost the games,nor do i care,https://www.reddit.com/r/BattleRite/comments/61nua2/my_teenage_son_got_caught_playing_jumong_am_i_a/,have u guys seen this shit,im dying,?,god you guys are retards,can you fuck off already,don't argue with me on this,dumbfuck,it's not up for discussion,then fuck off,and we're good,i'm not threatened,because im not interested in her.,Just stop bugging her.,ok?,then i'm saying he can't,and my word is law,according to me.,i'm the ultimate authority,everything i say is fact,everything i say is right and can't be argued,it'll always be that way,i mean you guys always meme it up,but i've yet to see anyone ever win an argument against me,namely because it's impossible,she's a good friend of mine, i'm not fucking her or anything.,randler,i've still yet to see a single tournament with you in it,after watching EU tournaments for like 6 months,who are you,literally who,do you EVER make top 4?,ever?,maylon,i can't beef cus im under contract and it'll go to LEDDIT,<:feelsSomethingman:285783203913138187>,P H A T,nah, honestly all this fighting isn't doing my mentality much good either,i'll kick it for a while, until the contact's up,and then you'll get 2 months,of built up rage,in the form of me probably getting myself banned from this place again,speaking of which,nyy, thanks for letting me back in,i appreciate it,even tho most of u are cunts,i like about 7 of you,😄,Even if she is i don't really care.,I'm like one of the most morally lacking manipulative terrible people on the entire planet,so her morals aren't really any of my concern,To be fair, it isn't like she asked me,please, you really think I do anything anyone tells me regardless of the circumstances?,I always just do whatever I feel like doing.,been that way my entire life,i felt like telling you not to bug her, so there.,actually,she's gotten mad at me a bunch of times,because im so sexist against women in the gaming scene,NEVER treat them equally,i told her the same thing i tell every chick in gaming, my eyes will be opened when i find a woman with the gaming talent I have. Something that frankly doesn't exist because there's no woman who would throw away 14 years of their life gaming all day like I have,a chick with the same gaming ability as me doesn't exist,to be fair, I don't even think a guy with the same gaming ability as me exists.,I wasn't home,such is life,we'll lose more now that the champ i have 2600 games on got deleted,so it's sort of irrelevant either way,i've always been the thing holding the team together,im the clutch king,1v2 king,now it's so impossible,?,nothing i've said has been disproven,at my own house on my computer, i still have a 100% winrate.,I've lost 1 tournament ever, at my dad's,my team has lost 3 total, I wasn't in 2 of them.,If you play me in my element, on my setup on under like 60 ping,I actually don't lose,orb has 60 hp,shifu deleted,hard life,?,I never said we'd have 100% orb rate, I said we should.,ya but who cares,everything i say is right always,including right now,when i say i didn't say that,even if you can find proof of me saying it,you can't be right,you're EU.,nobody from EU has ever been correct about anything,since the dawn of time,that's why scientists call it "The Continent of Incorrect Persons",it's true, look it up,of course,intelligence doesn't equate to your worth,i just happen to be smartest and worth the most,coincidence,but my IQ is higher than yours. And if we're being statistically honest probably everyone here minus maybe 1 or 2 people,idk who they'd even be,142.,it's 9 1/2 actually,I'm pretty above average in almost everything.,can't really think of anything im below average at,actually, you're right,im like exactly average,5'9 or so,i guess im below average weight, but i wasn't always. it was cause i dedicated my life to gaming and haven't done anything else for like 13 years,I used to actually be super in shape,but that was like 10 years ago,nah klerny, IQ is simply your capacity to grasp concepts and learn things,in other words, it's your "talent",for all things,some people are more inclined to certain things, like math or music or something.,But the idea is that with a higher IQ you'll typically learn faster and more efficiently than someone with a lower one,at just about everything,Obviously.,IQ is an arbitrary metric, though it is a pretty rigerous test that goes into many different mental aspects,it doesn't cover everything, obviously,nothing could.,I was told average IQ is 100, but i refuse to believe that.,I thought until like 3 weeks ago it was 120,or 130,something like that,that i was barely above average,but apparently not,how so,tfw no minitown,according to math, i'm extremely smart,but idk how much of that i believe,my mom's IQ is higher than mine and she's the dumbest person i've ever met.,like ever,she thinks im way smarter than her, which i agree with,but IQ would disagree,dunno,one of my many talents,It's just a hobby.,tfw no minitown,rifle,get mini to make a surprised face,so we can have :minichamp:,i will spam it,24/7,zzz,https://www.twitch.tv/videos/132106722?t=52m32s,buff croak,losing?,You must be joking.,We just won the first game.,We're using the same comp as them.,croak/ashka/oldur,why would i be on suicide watch?,our comp we played for 3 days beat the best team in EU on their main comp they've been playing for 6 months,like i said when we're in our element, in our own homes on NA ping, there's not really any way to win,good effort by them though,the ping barely matters with that comp, given how many EU players have 100 ping.,I have 100 ping to US west, where I can play totally fine.,You can only make invalid excuses for so long.,We have 160 ping to EU,averse has 210.,I'll send you a screenshot if you don't believe me.,We can't play EU because our ping is ridiculous,yours isn't nearly as bad.,untrue. EU teams have beaten every NA team except us from the beginning. Why? Because they're actually playing on the same ping as west coast NA players, sometimes even less.,Obviously it isn't true for everyone.,But you guys way overstate the effect it has, especially on ult chain comps,where you simply can't miss,eoekas has 80.,I have 60.,case in point.,No, the idea is simply that the wiring from EU to NA is better than vice versa, i'm not sure why.,idk how internet actually works,but typically you guys have lower ping than us,then there you go,how can you use it as an excuse forever?,that doesn't work considering im better.,You're entitled to your opinion, but the reality is you're just trying to justify a loss from a scenario where you can still play well enough to beat every single other team.,Because we've only played the characters for 2 days instead of 6 months.,That's just the difference in skill.,Actually, i should correct myself.,Me and ninjas have only played croak/oldur respectively for ONE day.,Nah, it's just us.,I made a major mistake 1 or 2 rounds, the same is true for averse and ninjas.,Once we realized those mistakes, we adjusted our play,and boom, better than wuzac and hotbiscuit,easy.,they started out the tournament better than us,and were worse within the first 5 rounds,that's why we're the best team,only the man who's never been beaten is god,you've lost before,i haven't,sorry.,nobody's ever beaten me on na,how many months has it been?,i've lost track,I wasn't home.,Onslaught has lost 3 tournaments since we founded the team. The first 2 I overslept and didn't attend, the third one I wasn't at home using my monitor, mouse, keyboard, anything.,,Didn't even have a mousepad.,We even won a tournament against project horizon when averse was at a friend's house hours away and he played like total shit,nobody's ever beaten any of us just y'know, playing the game on our computers,ever,??????,I actually wasn't home though.,Construction outside my house. I had no internet for 5 days,dumb fucks cut my fios cable in half redoing the sidewalk,and since it was only my house, they didn't deem it high enough priority to get someone out soon,cause apparently there were only 2 trucks in the area,and you need some sort of glass wire fusing machine thing,to do it,isn't just like splicing cables,ripped in pasta,😦,Yep.,why?,i dont wanna spend too much time in discord right now,because im streaming,drop by if u wanna talk about it,wait,mr2 is a one piece character,and he's a crossdressing pansexual faggot flamingo fuck,explain,,that's arakune,some sort of,cum spider bug,bone,nightmare thing,idk he's sick af,60-90 business years,business years,yeah nyy's picture is arakune,he started using it after i told him about arakune,char is pretty sick,?,that's true,i believe you had a different pic beforehand,maybe im misremembering,oh, word,cus u see nyy,he's actually an amalgym of like,bugs and bones and death,that happens to just,have a mask,that always looks the same,you wanna see arakune?,THIS is arakune,,🆒,pot on head,=,shifu prodigy,"The only one who can beat me... is me",-Croak,someone take the quote of aomine saying "the only one who can beat me is me" and poorly photoshop croak's face overtop,i'll pay one million keks,i was i was genetically predispositioned,to lose to day 2 croak/oldur,after practicing 6 months on only that champ,real talk, if someone randomly picked shifu like that and beat my shifu,or our comp at all,i wouldn't just quit the game,i'd publicly lynch myself,for the shame i've brought on my family and friends,how do u lose to my croak and ninjas' oldur and averse's ashka,we're all bad,just still better,did they miss the part where i actually played pretty insane with the exception of like 2 rounds,i played better than my shifu,croak just has SO much better of a kit,there's nothing he's worse at,?,As soon as shifu was nerfed,the fate of the world was decided,how many months was i saying "once shifu's nerfed, i'll show you what it looks like when i play a champion that's actually strong",remember that?,almost 1v3's blankz team multiple times yesterday,1v3'd,on my day 2 croak,so many rounds averse would just fuck up and die instantly with like 200 score,and me and ninjas end with 1400 score a piece,oldur and croak are beyond nuts,lol,they're so absurdly strong they can practically 2v3,i don't think any comp beats them in 2v2,the only comp that comes close in 2v2,is pest/ashka,but croak destroys them both 1v1,like he does to literally every champion,so idk,croak doesn't just win 1v1,he wins 1v2,and if he lands spit on 3, he wins 1v3,he's SO strong,i never imagined he would be this strong until i played him,you just sit in the face of bakko, shifu, rk, without even landing your stun, space, anything,you just out trade them,more damage, more sustain, lower cds,he's just so nuts,i genuinely think oldur croak is the best 2v2 comp in the game, all memes aside.,I'd be shocked if anything beat it,nah,lol nyy 70 hp,one incap is death,you lose about 120,if you follow up their escape they're dead,and croak has about,25 gapclosers,Pest is still the best healer and nobody can beat it.,Croak is simply croak.,he defines the meta with his mere existence.,Whatever works best with croak is the best,that's the entire conversation,no, pest doesn't work as well with croak as oldur does,pest is significantly stronger overall,but he can get zoned off of mid and healing allies, and he can't always follow up on croak incaps over walls, through bubble/firewall, etc,oldur will ALWAYS follow up on croak,on top of that, having the ult "get out of one croak combo and live" button on your team is nice,oldur makes more sense 3v3,but pest is definitely better overall,yeah,no way to wall it,no skillshot,can't be stopped by walls,NOTHING can stop it,the only thing in the game that can stop it are otherside, nado, oldur ult, etc,but those won't be up nearly as often as you get incapped,all i do is stealth,get hit in the face with like 4 ashka m1's and a Q,but my spit is on 2 of them,and i take 0 damage,even without my healer,literally spit at a guy,then if u take some damage,u spit at a guy again,o ya,i didn't use croak's blind once the entire tourney,it's a useless ability,deceit and his ult are both gamebreaking,never worth the meter,the most retarded thing about croak comps in all honesty,is that ashka's Q stuns long enough for his ult to hit, but for some reason ashka's ult ALSO stuns and has like a long endlag where you're forced to sit in the fire,so you eat incap > ashka q > ashka ult > stun combo,oldur can throw one m1 and an e for good measure if he isn't busy healing,literally instantly killed from full hp,0 skillshots involved,can do it from halfway across the map AND over walls,don't even need vision,if ashka's ult hitbox was half the size it is now AND it didn't stun,it'd still be super strong,like wtf is ashka,yeah ashka's damage is literally,q > ult > m1,and it's like,100 damage,why can he do 100 damage,wtf is that,dont u insult maylon,maylon works very hard to put bread on the table,u ungrateful wife,i mean, dayz clone is unfair. it's like calling every FPS a doom clone. The idea of a massively multiplayer zombie game in a vast open world, like walking dead in video game form, is a sick concept everyone would love,the problem is how poorly executed they are all,just cheap quick cash ins,i hate when i can't finish my point before you retort because discord's autistic fucking servers lag my messages 2 full minutes,Fucking christ.,"battlerite is the NEW and IMPROVED BLC","to prove it, we've added not double, but TRIPLE the stealth uptime!","THREE TIMES AS MUCH FUN",<:PogChamp:282891715810033665> //,croak's stealth is up so much,i actually find myself willingly not using it,because i prefer just doing damage,<@150354957613268992> not every game, but the really good games are too hard for casual gamers to get into,stuff like ssbm, brood war, marvel,the FGC is where gaming gods are,and where hype is,–]Snoobl 17 points 1 day ago

Can't play him braindead anymore, so glad ranged are finally decent",I've seen AT LEAST 5 times as many posts saying "thank god melees are finally nerfed" as the opposite,not even joking,over the last week or so,you forget these people are low elo,lol,gold/plats,with like 6 kids,play the game 5 minutes per month,come in here and thank god shifu was nerfed,fuckin cunts,also notice you've picked the ONE thread there that says that, you've apparently missed the other 200 threads the last many days,i got in so many arguments about how melees were never good,that my own sponsor intervened,and told me to stop fighting with people on reddit,for my own reputation,literally EVERYONE thought ranged was underpowered,and shifu was nuts broken,and croak was fine,every gold player (including SLS, and teldo) are on the same page,fucking golds,<:feelsSomethingman:285783203913138187>,verosk,apparently it's not that they keep a particularly close eye on it,it's that the ENTIRE na scene wants me and my team banned,probably so they can have the money for themselves,like, have sent complants to the ceo of onslaught,they get shit constantly,cus of the way i act,so they were like,"hey fuck off already",and i was like "ok",ya,an hour long stern talking to,meeting with the ceo, cofounder, etc,they were like "stop talking shit to EU teams","we know they're cucks, just stfu",so i went "ok,they were like,you aren't WRONG persay,you're just being right,WAY too loudly,so be quiet pls,No, actually,the opposite,you guys are the good ones,it's the entire NA scene that wants me banned,the BRhouse discord and all that,you know i trust u guys,it's funny,every time i talk to anyone about u guys, averse, sponsors, NA friends, anyone, they're all like "I hate the EU discord, they're all backstabbing untrustworthy fucks. Assholes. I hate them all",And I always come to bat for you guys,im tellin u guys, there's a reason im still here,ya eoekas,exactly,well you know how it is,everyone wants it to be esports and whatever,i mean i get it, i do,but why do i have to be the figurehead of onslaught. I mean I like the glory, but why does all the blame of "captain of team onslaught" get put on my actions? my teammates and my sponsor are endangered because of shit i say and do,and imo it shouldn't work that way, but it does,people judge EVERYONE in my group based off me,so i can't flame now,it's lame,attention is fine,but give the negative attention to me,not to averse,not to onslaught,averse doesn't deserve guys who spam him in whispers calling him a nigger on literally 30 different twitch accounts 12 hours a day for 3 days straight,because i flamed an EU team,like where's the logic for that?,or for flaming in solo queue,or for flaming on reddit,they literally watch my every move,LITERALLY every move,even twitch chats and shit,zzzz,they want me to be the face of the battlerite,like it or not, i am,and it's a bad look right now,verosk those aren't my words dude,don't look at me,they legit said that,if onslaught continues to dominate when the game goes f2p and we stay a staple super strong team,do you really think the captain won't constantly be watched?,i've gotta literally become esports,shit sux,even so,CLG wouldn't want me acting this way,that's the whole point,no sponsor and not even my teammates will let me act the way i do,cus it makes THEM get shit,even if they dont particularly care,what i do,fuck bitch <:PogChamp:282891715810033665>,well,there's a line between confident and cocky,and im way WAY over the line,that's all the issue is,there's also a difference between trash talk/banter and legit rudeness/bming,again, im way over it,i just dont censor myself at all,gotta start doing that,ya,agree xaynox,<@98465602670186496> just reached the end of the summit war arc,feels bad man,,this right here,THIS is a feelsbadman,difference between a plat oldur and plat sirius,plat older has 1 digit IQ, 3 digit winrate,sirius has the opposite,feels good man,100 IQ on sirius is like,600 IQ on croak,he's so low tier,If enemy is Melee:
Take Q resets space rite
When melee comes near you, space
When melee comes near you again, Q
When melee comes near you AGAIN, space
When melee is still trying, R

Profit,someone asked,how 2 oldur,so they answered,nyy,you finished one piece right?,i just finished the summit war arc,shit is TOO sick,your boy is a fuckin legend,,weird u guys are talking about it,my homie's asking me to go to disneyland,like, right now,🤔,look ima tell u straight up,fuck disney,ur better off at universal or busch gardens or some amusement park,disney's fuckin lame,oh well like,45 minutes from my house is S H I E K R A,busch gardens doesn't have animals. It's literally just an amusement park.,With giant coasters and shit,aka S H I E K R A,and montu,and like,8 other ones,i forgot the name of,ik shiekra had the sharpest drop of any coaster in the country,at least it did when i was a kid,was like 87 degrees or something,florida is too cold,i meant degrees as in like.. the angle of the drop,but it is also like 87 degrees here all the time,ya florida is sick af,i've been all over the country and florida kicks the shit out of every other popular state,weather is SO nice,everything's so chill,ya,it's too warm for anyone else i've ever spoken to also,but it's too cold for me,i wear hoodies in like 75 degree weather,it's like,30 c,or something,ya if it's like,29.9c or below,i dont leave my house either,ROFL sweaters,im glad im not a sweater,i can sit in like a 100+ degree place for hours,and not sweat a drop,but especially when i went to ssbm tournies and stuff,you'd get guys who literally like,turn a white shirt grey,level sweating,and they're like, dripping sweat off of forehead,im like sitting there in my jacket,cold,can't play game because cold hands,venue is 100 degrees,mfw,nyy idk about you,but i ALWAYS try to be as close to naked as possible,why the fuck would i ever wear clothes,when i could not wear them,florida SWAG,when im wearing like 69 layers of clothing,i ask myself,who the fuck enjoys this,one piece so sick,it's literally flexing on people weaker than you for no reason,the show,<@250636384774127616> ya the beginning is. But it's still ongoing. Everything from episode 300 onward is the best looking anime i've ever seen,look,how is ANY option except spring or summer possible,if you like winter you live in a bunket is syberia,if you like fall you're gay,bunker*,who the fuck,wants to step on something cold and damp,oh shit, gotta go get some groceries,let me walk into the frozen wet dank abyss,that is outside,during winter,no thanks,^,nobody ever leaves the house,what the fuck kind of degen are you,i willingly leave my house like, twice per year,and both times it's because someone is like fatally wounded,and then i go back inside like immediately,what lake,what wind,what frost,i live in FLORIDA,🔥,,literal florida man,hat and all,burning alive,because it's florida,,9-0 today with croak,yeah this seems fair,i dont even think i've lost a round yet,Croak record the last 3 days NOT counting games against averse,25-1,holy FUCK,what is croak,95%+ winrate,even counting the games against averse im over 75%,33-9 counting those,well unfortunately,im the best croak in the world now,and i say he's broken,so tell sls i said that,21st bday,PogChamp,yo retards,NA made a google doc of their complaints like you guys did,said i could add you if you wanted,y/n,>base damage and healing increased from 8 to 11,>orb control, higher m1/m2 rotations, better sustain,raigon broken,im ALL in,supports in this game smell like shit,good, fuck em,gayest supports in any game i've ever played tbh,they're just dps that heal,which is also what dps are,both melee and ranged,every champ is the same,literally the biggest issue with the game,20 champs and all 20 of them are the same champ,with slightly different playstyles,pearl is just a more healing less dps focused version of varesh,and a more burst/less consistent healing but also less movement version of poloma,if you think about it in this way,they're actually all the same,every champ is the same as every other champ,ya, they're the most similar of any game i've ever played,that's why for months when i started i said "this is a fighting game, not a moba",because they feel like fighting game characters,all the same base kits with slight tweaks to alter playstyles,the problem is unlike a fighting game it's not fast or mechanically challenging, so all outcomes are boring and predetermined,everything feels the same as everything else,>movement speed increase from jade's exq removed,>flat movespeed on stealth turned into fading snare,well, it's a fucking START,at least now you have to be close to people when u stealth,instead of it also being a free gapcloser,ngl if i mained croak though and i was 2 steps away from someone and i stealthed, if i walk at them and they walk straight backwards and i can't stun them,it's gonna be a HUGE nerf,nah, the "super sprint" only starts at the same speed it was at before,it's not like it decays from 100% movespeed increase, it decays from 15%,instead of a flat 15%,meaning the movespeed buff is probably only like the first step or 2,if that,it also matters how quickly it decays,does it decay in one step like most fading hastes, or does it decay over the duration of the entire stealth?,it'll be important which it is,then it isn't that big of a nerf tbh,if it slowly ticks down like, 3% per second for croak's 6 second stealth,he still pretty much has it the whole time,^,it means croak will only be able to close the gap from a step or two away now if you walk backwards,not being forced to burn a cd PogChamp,walking backwards PogChamp,<@98465602670186496> no matter how you spin it, it's worse than before,which is great,croak is already the most mobile melee in the game by far, his stealth having permahaste on it was too insane,one change at a time,well, i'd disagree,he also moves REALLY fast,like twice as fast as shifu,mobility wise,he also doesn't rely on walls, skillshots, anything else like some melees (namely shifu) do for their mobility,there's no "fucking up" with croak,he's ALWAYS super fast,24/7,he has 100% mobility uptime,^,eygrr is right,the problem wasn't being forced to burn a cd, it was  that it was a 50/50 where croak reacts to your choice and you still lose,If you don't space, croak stuns you and combos, if you do space, he burned your space and can get close enough to e or space on top of you once stealth ends. No matter what you choose, croak wins.,That's how croak always is,if you can space inbetween 2 people, you can even choose who you want to combo or focus after they BOTH burn an escape,it's ridiculous the amount of control he has,implying croak would ever stealth next to a pearl with silence,he's just gonna space twice on ur dps player nonstop,and you can't possibly stop him,you can't peel hard enough, his spit heals him for 14 and deals 14, his space deals 20 and heals for 14, toxin blades reapply spit debuff, he has like 3 ways to get the temporary highest dps in the game,the champ sticks too well and does too much damage,if there's a champ like pearl who he doesn't want to focus, he doesn't even need stealth,he can kill the opponent without it,best sticking + damage + mobility in the game,in one champion,You can't "read" croak's space. He uses stealth to force you into a range where he can space you,or he uses space to get in, then stealths, then e's, then spaces again,he just doesn't have cooldowns,there's always something up for a gapcloser AND an escape,^,all i do is miss my space and chunk someone for 25% of their Hp and force them to space anyway,then i use the second space to follow, stealth,wait for Q,R,stun,e through their petrify, or e out or whatever,spit at them for 4 seconds,which for some reason does all their health if it hits,repeat,croak is such a flowchart,i went 25-1 with him,and my croak sucks,there's no champ that beats him,no comp that stops him,he does whatever he wants,highest sustain on a melee + super long range over wall poke + highest mobility + highest dps + highest offensive pressure + good mid control,easy win,i've had so many rounds where my teammate gets like 120 score,and i get like 4 mids in a row and win 1c2,1v2,the score literally looks like,my teammate: 120 opponents: 600, 700, me: 1600,like wtf is croak,wtf IS that,no way lol,shifu's mid control sucks balls now that he can't get it off one incap,,on top of that, champs could always get him off of it and steal it,champs with higher burst like older or taya could steal it from him easily,croak can always take orb at any amount. 20, 32, 44, 60, whatever,he jumps in, slaps it a couple times,and it's the PERFECT amount,and his m1's are so fast you can't even react,and steal it from him,he can get 2 m1's before most ranged champs can get 1 to hit the orb,so he always steals it,god forbid a croak player like, waits next to the orb too with his 12 damage 0.01 second cast m1 to steal from a jumong or ashka or oldur or something post-burst,by baiting them into thinking you'll hit it,it's a mindgame where croak either wins or has advantage, always,much like his stealth,anyway i've gotta read this doc,i was gonna say,that ashka round 4 rite,in the NA doc just says,"is fucking ridiculous",it isn't 15%,it was like,80%,doubled the size of it,his crying is ridiculous,my croak is actually better than his,every time he's moving im like "that was terrible, do this instead to gapclose",he doesnt even know how to play his champ,because it was so op before,he didnt need to,i pm'd jeter,laughing at him,for agreeing with teldo,called him wrong,like 100 times,i mean,i was a true shifu one trick,and playing raigon or croak for me was easy,ROFL,the legend on my team,ILOVEMENX,gold 1 jade main,who was gold 7 months ago,and i remembered his name because he was so bad,even worse than i remembered,lost half a division,CLOAK,fucking averse,messages me,"you think shifu is better than croak now?",literally spit out my drink,so hard that it propelled me across my room,and through my wall,no xaynox,it doesn't,take it from the guy with the most shifu games of anyone by a lot,no situation you'd take shifu over raigon,let alone croak,no situation where you'd take raigon over croak either,they're entire tiers apart,raigon is still so bad,lol,but now he's definitely better than shifu at least,considering shifu got nerfed again this patch,SourPls,raigon's still shit,take it from the #1 raigon on earth,and that one im positive on,im not QUITE 100% that im the best croak,but im definitely the best raigon,every other raigon is so shit,it's unreal,including teldo,and all the people who have mained him since day 1,don't think i've dropped a round to anyone in 1v1 raigon dittos,like a single round,and that's with pretty constant fuckups,no,people play them for 1000 games,get 60% winrates,make elaborate 10 paragraph guidelines on how to play them,but they're still shit,lol,nikita,my raigon is better than ur bakko,noob,noob,noob,tfw ur actually raigon irl and it's not a good thing,VICTORIES ARE OBTAINED VIA MANY DEFEATS XD,XD,XD,"croak mains on this patch",http://i.imgur.com/aCowDYr.gif,LUL,Nikita <:PogChamp:282891715810033665>,ya,he's so nerfed,ya,but his Q was nerfed,again,swag,nerf the worst counter in the game not 1,not 2,but THREE patches in a row,hello sls,half the immaterial time for a .5 second 35% haste?,he barely breaks even on that,if he even does,immaterial is the entire champ since he has no sustain now,remove more sustain and give him more mobility?,it's 0.1 away from 50%?,???,so functionally 50%,it is when u only have 0.8 to start with,he should get 6 seconds of immaterial if his counter gets hit,still wouldn't be able to 1v1 jumong,no,it's just fact,shifu even after this buff is like,3rd or 4th worst champ in the game,there wasn't a need for a compensation nerf for SUCH a small buff,when he was already bottom tier,wtf is sls,given, with his m1 buff i think he has the highest dps in the game now,which is nice,but it's useless if you can't trade with anyone,cus 0 sustain,replace shifu's Q with deceit,replace shifu's m2 with spit,i won't complain anymore,:^),i'd rather have a 14 damage 14 healing aoe poke over walls i can spam twice,than a 26 damage snaring nuke on a 2 second cd,spit is PRETTY good,it might be the only ability in the game better than deceit,other than croak's space, which is also better,wtf is croak,wtf is sls,at least it doesn't heal him,o wait,owo,ya, he's super unviable,i never see cro-,,oh, nevermind,u guys are too confident,blankkz winning is impossible,i'll play croak and crush wuzac,just like last week,zzzz,eh?,how the hell is he gonna win in eu,if he cant win against "inferior" na players,playing chars they dont play,to be fair,if i was in EU,i would've quit too,we only play still because the money is so consistent,but the competition was too fierce on EU,for the amount of effort u needed to put in,nyy, aren't you and joltz and iska playing?,you think you'll lose to them?,i mean sure, they play the best comp,but ur better,u guys have it all wrong,just pick their comp,none of the players on that team are skilled,the comp is just insanely broken,there are plat players who would wipe out GC teams,playing that comp,that's fair,ohhh,it appears with this patch,shifu might be back,well last time,there were tons of youtubers/streamers that WERENT paid,who just heard about the game and were on the hype train,that was even how i heard about the game,and BR is fun for most people for a couple hundred games,they missed their best window already,right nyy,klerny there were many i saw,at least a couple dozen,and it wasn't like i was trying to watch any and all BR content,it was everywhere for like... 10 days,and that was it,then rip,i mostly saw youtubers/lpers who also do first impressions series on new/upcoming games,that had played it and all of them were like,"ya this shit's really good","like really good","never heard of it, didn't expect it to be good, it's really good",that was why i got it,i mean,to be fair,long after everyone quit,i was playing 13 hours a day still,loving it,me and averse didnt get bored until about 1200 hours,which is still more than like anyone else has,3+ months later,lol,my time wasnt very padded,like 200 afk hours,out of 1200,and now like,4 months later,im at like 1400,lol,same with averse,dropped off SO hard,i mean,there was a site that tracked how many hours you had in league,and would even go across multiple accounts,and i added my like 18 permabanned accounts or whatever i could remember playing on,not even counting my old s2 and s1 ones i forgot the tags for,and i had like, 6000 hours,or 7000,something like that,for that much money anyone would do something unfun,like i was getting KINDA bored of BR at like 400 hours,but i played 14 hours a day still until i considered myself unbeatable,which was another 500 hours,what nyy it was a HUGE nerf,now he's barely slower SOMETIMES,HUGE nerf,teldo said it wasn't warranted,he can get why they did it, because people complained, but from a balance pov they didnt need to,actual quote from his stream yesterday,ikr,lol,ran into shifu player,called me a dirty fotm picker,when i was on raigon,???????????,and then he 3-0'd me,because he had oldur,and i was raigon,??????,shut up u jew,i was the only shifu player for 3 straight months,and i won every tournament for the entire 3 months,u cocksucker,more like,shifu gets 200 score,oldur gets 38,000,and i lose,cus oldur,OwO,same,but now ninjas plays oldur,u wanna see fotm picker,watch us copy wuzac's comp,and win,<:LUL:269941798107873286>,when does season end,if it's soon im gonna have to play croak again soon,to get gc,so i get the mount next season,is the only reason,it's worth nothing now,but slightly more next season,only like 40 people with it,o wait but they give it for 2's and 3's too right?,nvm everyone has it still,zzzz,god people are so behind the times,"how can you say croak/ashka/oldur is op? the arguable best team in the world onslaught doesn't use any of those champs and they win everything","except they used all 3 of them last week and won","wait really?",<:LUL:269941798107873286>,ikr?,since when is it arguable?,who are you gonna argue is better?,<:LUL:269941798107873286>,i already told her to fuck off,nikita,ur bad,I read "m'1ady",too much br,rofl,<:feelsnikitaman:284752940290539531>,rofl,nikita's dream team,213,321,and 123,<:PogChamp:282891715810033665>,well,all 3 of the members of our teams are gaming prodigies,I'm sure if the 3 of us were on a team in literally any game we'd dominate,like i've been absolute top tier in at least a dozen games, averse was challenger in league, ninjas was high diamond in LoL and he's literally played/playing every game i've ever heard of. Legit like i went on a spree with averse for a while where we were playing a new game every 3 or 4 days just to find something fun and new to do and ninjas already played all of them. His accomplishments aren't as great but he is also barely 15 years old,and even if ninjas ended up not being as much of a prodigy, you could replace ninjas with jeffy and have the same impact,jeffy also god at like a dozen games like me, challenger LoL, etc,natural talent doesn't exist,but people who game 16 hours a day for 10+ years so they're instantly god at everything they touch do exist,IE: me and averse,and jeff,ofc,but that's like saying "talent doesn't exist in baseball, there's no average IQ guy who just picks up a baseball and throws it 100 mph",like sure,everyone has to practice to be good at anything,but people who have experience and natural ability to learn faster are "talented",that's the only definition of talent,for example, I was better than the people in my local SSBM scene who had been playing for 2-4 years by my second month playing the game.,Everyone said I was a prodigy and talented, and I practiced a lot and attended every weekly tournament,it's not like i won my first tournament,but certainly there's talent,so then what about when me and my other 8 year old friends would "compete" for fun in video games as kids,and i magically won at every single game,against every single friend,where's the explanation for that?,The point is gaming "talent" comes from gaming. But that's true for anything.,that's like saying "a kid who's watched michael phelps swim would probably learn to swim easier than someone who didn't if they both were the same in every other way",experience + natural ability to learn quickly = talent,so where did i disagree with that?,im extremely talented regardless,verosk, that's exactly the point,not only were we good at games from the start, but we also put in an IMMENSE amount of hours,that's what being truly talented means,it means that you have high potential, but you don't lazily sit around, you also maximize that potential so nobody can be better than you,it means you're in the top 1% to begin with and then you put in 110% of your own effort,to reach the top 0.00001%,people with the same mentality as me would rather get shot in the head than get 2nd place,a true talent is someone like ninjas,who has potential potentially exceeding people like me and averse, since he's comparable with 10% the hours and experience,plus being half a dozen years younger,ya, i was really really good at games by the time i was 13 or 14,mostly fighting games and rhythm games back then,im sure averse was good when he was 15 or 16,ninjas is just getting good and he just turned 15,people with lots of talent and free time tend to show their skill around highschool,since that's when ur brain develops enough to actually learn,depends how many hours the top players have,though generally, i'd agree,i don't even think 1000 hours is necessary,for me, im normally near the top within the first few hundred,that's true,took me years in league,took everyone years in league,and i never got challenger,only diamond 1 50 LP,feels bad man,the s3 clamp was real,+1 +1 +1 +1,-22,why god,well think about the fact that the top players as long as they play continue to improve as well,you think someone new could come into the BR scene,and reach the level of me/averse/ninjas in 6 months?,given that's how long we've been playing,and we'll improve the whole time?,very unlikely,i think we're a rare case though,me averse and ninjas are big fish in a small pond, and not in the general sense of "you're only good because the game is small" rather the opposite, we'd be good even in games with huge communities and we happen to all be playing a small game,we're true prodigies playing a game with a small playerbase and virtually no other competition,it's unrealistic anyone will ever catch up,we're actual BIG FISH,and BR is a small pond,not in a moba or a game like BR, where the game is all about experience and communication and synergy,people won't pass us since the mechanical aspect isn't as intense as something like cs,the only way to be better would be to put in more hours than me and averse,and nobody's put in half the hours of me OR averse,so it's impossible,u can say that, but there isn't any evidence to support it,xaynox ur implying things im saying because they don't need to be said,we practice with perfect effort and efficiency,that's why the only way is with more hours,max effort max effeciency max game knowledge max mechanical skill max base talent,if there was a chart of different skills,we'd all be perfect 10's,both the starting stats and the way we improve,you couldn't do better unless you were 1. more naturally talented or 2. put in more time,since 1. doesn't exist, you'd have to do 2.,and 2 won't happen either,onslaught > all,if there was a lan we'd win,there's nobody who can beat us anywhere on earth,not even on a bad day,not even on an off comp,nobody,we don't have the same ping to EU than EU has to NA,averse gets 210 to EU east,I get like 170,it's not playable, or we would,trust me, we want the money enough,no,EU teams have like 80-130,and the ones with 130 normally dont play,eoekas has 80,ask him,lol,i swear,to god,ask him,urself,<@179306091056726016>,80 ping,useast,y/n,my point,is the lowest ping on our team to EU is like 160,that's the BEST ping,soooo lol,btw im playing croak again in solo queue,first time since nerf,...,i can't even tell he was nerfed,dont feel it AT ALL,playing against oldur jumong,destroying them,one of them is a gc smurf,????,wtf croak,LUL,just hit a double ult on pest cus he got forced to space once by my lucie using deadly inject,biggest mistake of his life,i ulted him, it completely missed both, STILL HIT BOTH,then i stunned him,into lucie goo,he died from like 80% hp,just typed "lol" in chat,mfw,no,croak does that to every champ,and the thing is, he doesn't even need to have his teammate make u space,he does it himself with Q,as soon as he's near you,space up to them,Q,wait for space,E,ult,dead,endlag is too long,but that is an interesting idea,i'll try that! thanks iska,i never thought of it that way,always wondered why sometimes i'd ult someone and instant stun and they'd eat the stun,cus they were trying to dodge ult,makes more sense now,ya,nah i see it all the time,it just didn't like,click in my brain,that was what was happening,i always assumed they just lost the 50/50 guessing when i'd stun,oooo,im running into a new jumong player i dont recognize,and he's good,he plays just like averse but with way worse aim,getting 2 battlerite games in 45 minutes <:PogChamp:282891715810033665>,the super slow queues actually keep my interest for BR high,because i always have to wait 20 minutes longer than i want,to play a match,just had my first loss of the patch on croak,shifu was on my team,LUL,trickmasta is an NA random,who complained pest needed buffs,when his smurf was 100% winrate in champion 3,after the ranged rework,100% winrate,in champion 3,lol,nyy,what u dont expect,is that that isn't the truth,that's why it gets upvoted,the "delay" getting upvoted,is really a delay for a delay,leading to a 2 week patch,i have positive karma,now THAT is amazing,given i've been hated in every community i've ever been in,for honor, LoL, osu, battlerite, etc,man,this is really the arakune patch,croak still unbeatable if i really still feel like winning,jumong strongest solo queue ranged,raigon and shifu both strong,every one of my 4 chars is top 10,and one of them is 1st,another is 2nd,😄,my mind has changed a bit,he's still the worst of the 4 for sure,but he's good against maybe 3 or 4 champs now,and one of them is croak,so he's decent,he just hits like a truck,13 damage spear on a 7 second cd, 10 damage m1, 26 damage snare m2,he hits HARD,he doesn't do anything else except hit hard,but he's probably the king of solo punishing mistakes now,besides jumong,jumong does like 150 damage AND heals a ton and is immaterial the whole time,i dont even jumong,they'd be filthy once i was done with them,tbh,<:feelsnikitaman:284752940290539531>,god 1 loss sets you back 3 wins,which isn't normally that bad,except the queue times are 20-80 minutes,zzzzzzzz,takes me 3 hours to get the wins back,with my 80% winrate,every time i lose a game as raigon,i switch back to croak,3-0,3-0,3-0,go back to raigon,^,lost another game,jumong oldur vs my plat 8 jade,fuck my LIFE,doesnt help that they're both champion,and my jade is plat 8,wtf is that,back to champ 2,zzzzz,literally called GG in advance,managed to win a round 1v2,zzz,z,z,z,z,z,got an int feeder in my game,and he goes,"if u werent toxic i was gonna leave so you'd save rating, but now i def won't" and he just afked,so i go,"lemme return the favor",left the game on purpose, took double rating loss,sniped him next game, smashed him 3-0,called him shit,im a man of principles,lost 100 points in 3 consecutive losses cus of him,had to prove a point tho,worth it,i care way less about points,than i do about the huge size of my dick,fuck that retard,"mankey" the varesh player,zzzz,ya,he was like,"well i was gonna leave to save u rating but now i wont cus ur toxic" and he intent lost,so i left instead,sniped him,destroyed him,worth,ROFL,me irl,Nikita <:PogChamp:282891715810033665>,<:thunking:269957648395403274>,i AM elo hell,half of my matches i find (which are 20 minutes per game btw) someone on the opposing team disconnects before game starts,literally half,nobody wants any,and the people that do want any,are jumong players,pls no,😄,<:PogChamp:282891715810033665>,A C C E L E R A T I N G,vrrrrrrrrooooooooom,up 2-0,teammate gets 100 score 3 straight rounds,lose 3-2,because jumong beats us 1v2,2 rounds in a row,with 2 hp left both times,made no mistakes,he just doesn't take damage,deals infinite damage,retarded fuckin champ,back to champ 2 again,zzzzzz,i wasn't home?,and i beat him with his own comp,our whole team has been playing the chars for 2 days each,me and ninjas 1 day actually,smashed them,i've said that a braindead monkey with 600 ping could play that comp,for months,and i was right,like i always am,i needed to beat them quick cus i had somewhere to be,not my fault i was on a different new setup with different mouse/kb and 30 fps,and they beat us by 1 round,using the best comp and most tilting strat possible,thats why we had to bury them last week,cus we were mad,beat them with their own comp,to prove a point,ya if by "quick" you mean in a 2 hour long grand finals,cus they waited till 1 second left and took 10 minute breaks every match,game 3 round 9,zzzz,if i had known they were gonna smell like shit,i would've just thrown and let them win,so i could go do something less boring,we would if averse didn't have 210 ping,a ranged player can't play on that ping cus he wouldn't even be able to ashka Q within the incap time,but hotbiscuit plays on half that ping,so it's fine,the comp is just a series of doing the same braindead combo over and over again off incaps, and on orb when there's nobody incapped,you can play that comp on 120 ping just as well as you can on 20,no counters, no skillshots, no having to react to hitting counters or something because all of you have easy, far, over wall instant escapes,it's the easiest comp for high ping i can imagine,but u can't play anything on 200 ping in any game ever made,so it's rip,cus blc isn't br?,how should i know?,a few hundred hours is what it is for most games,so around there,we're talking like,best in the world,not like,really good,top 10,probably 300 hours or so,i'd pick whoever was strongest/melee,why are the names,so much sicker,in BLC,i mean i'd start with whoever was coolest and then pick the strongest melee for pro play,so i'd probably main ranid swagsassin,ya but like in BR,i was gonna main croak,the only reason i picked shifu instead,was because jeff, my irl friend, picked croak,and we couldnt main the same champ since we played together every day,i was actually originally a varesh main,if u wanna talk coolness of char design,only cool champ in BR,the champs are SO boring and bland,how do u make a character with the concept of RK boring and bland and ugly and gay,he's literally,"the grim reaper with sick ass black/purple aura",most generic thing ever,but then they make him a hunchback with this long fucking retard down syndrome mask,and he's the least cool thing i've ever seen,why,im all in,i just had a plat 1 sirius,against freya/pest,we somehow 3-0'd them,played the best of my entire life,gained like 40 points,swagggggggggggg,they were both champ too,best pest on NA (besides ninjas) and the 2nd best freya iirc,R A I G O N,this plat 1 kid,is a fucking,GANGSTER,got him on my team again,and we're smashing everyone,he's ninjas 2.0,im in love,ninjas was once,that plat,is the point,,this kid,is thug,,that score,holy fuck,96% hp,raigon's borderline top tier,just WAY worse than croak,he's like half as strong as croak,i actually think,with the minor croak nerf,and pretty major raigon buff,raigon actually counters croak now,he HAS a counter,PogChamp,it's a matchup he ACTUALLY loses,not that it matters, since u just spam spit at him and get mid,like u do with every annoying croak MU,why fight ur opponent,when u can,not fight them,OwO,"this is truly melee hell",zab wtf is wrong with u,u goddamn meth addict,u shut the fuck up,u fish smelling shit licker fuck,ily zab,never change,ROFL,"imbred",im dying,Got GC back,Took long enough,7-2 on croak, 1-0 on shifu, 23-7 on raigon,31-9 overall,not took bad,73% or something,too*,ya the mental illness is being that competitive in a game with such a small playerbase,it's futureproofing,if the game becomes big, it makes sure i'll be the best so i can make that fat esports money,if it doesn't, it's a waste of time,not like there's anything better to do with ur time tho,at all,nobody lied to themselves,i was still having fun playing 10 hours a day with 2k games,like SO much fun,i dont now,but that's cus the community died, queue times are long, and there's nobody left to face me skillwise,not cus the game got any worse,if the game had 10k players i'd still play it 12 hours a day,i have the dedication of a machine,my shield drops,are fire,coke is pretty sick,can verify,def snort,100%,runny nose = 🔥,i did coke a couple times,never got addicted,mostly cus like,shit was too expensive to buy,to get addicted to,besides i always preferred cheaper shit like 2cp and 2ci to begin with,better high,imo,^,every time he types cbt,im like,????????,^,dawg,i was in there,the research drugs on the daily are how u become a shifu master,just ask ninjas,it's joke,ROFL,i dont remember like ever having a bad experience on them.,They're like, pretty aight.,Probably not great for your mental or physical wellbeing longterm tho,i was never into hallucinogenic stuff,only did shrooms a couple times,no LSD or anything,sick,how good were u at BLC,after that,prolly,he was like one of the best blc players,at least i think maylon was,idk, i wasn't there,i heard he was SICK,oOoOo,talking the goodest shit,i've ever seen,verosk > women <:PogChamp:282891715810033665>,where's jack,word,where's finlev/neewha since

plays, i appreciate it,btw,i was 1st place in my tourney,and im already out,i've been up 26 hours, didn't realize how long tourney was or how tired i was when i regged for it,just threw my chips

good friend of mine, this cute little kid in FL,he's a 14 year old marth playing prodigy. name is MrLz. I was 2-0 against him in tourney back when I played, but he's come super far and he's making waves nationally,he's a super amazing person,dude RANDOMLY is undergoing open heart surgery,completely out of nowhere,just happened yesterday,hope he's ok,i didn't rly take that kid under my wing, because tbh he's always been around my skill level, we're really back and forth,idk what the whole details of the situation were,but his heart literally gave out,for some reason,they say even if he survives the emergency surgery, he won't be able to participate in "any high stress activities",as if playing high level SSBM at 200 apm on a stage isn't high stress,so it's really sad for him,but, well, guess im back to being 3rd best marth in the state again,rly rip,still, that's scary,he's 14,idk what i'd do if something like that happened to ninjas,i consider him like a little brother,i've beefed with him so many times,beat him in so many moneymatches,that kid's a gangster,there was a tourney, one of the last ones i entered before i quit, like 9 months ago. And they had what was called the amateur bracket as a side event because this is a big NATIONAL level tourney and 99% of people don't make it out of pools,The rules were, if you were never on your local region's player ranking, you could compete, so it was "noobs only" and of course unknown/underrated players,This was literally a week before i got placed in my PR (it was heavily delayed for inactivity, and i jumped all the way to 2nd instantly, so i was super underrated) and Lz joined it,but i didn't reg in time, so i ask my pro player friend who's there from out of state to talk to the tourney organizer since they're friends to see if he can get me in late right,and he goes "Look, be honest with me, how good do you think his odds are of winning?",and my friend goes "really good, this guy's actually a beast, u have no idea",and the fucking TO responds with "well in that case, I can't do it. If he was just a noname sure, but we've already seeded and everything, we can't just let some random unseeded guy tear through bracket",Long story short, Lz wins the entire bracket, heart surgery kid,and i moneymatch him right after,swept him 3-0 in marth ditto,i was so salty,i was like "why didn't i get to run train on literally everyone in the amateur bracket on stream with 20k viewers like a cool kid",me vs Lz grand finals would've been sooooo hype,rip,speaking of ssbm, im going to FL's biggest tournament in like 3 days for the weekend. CEO dreamland.,You guys should watch on stream, i'm really rusty from not playing 6 months but i'll still make it out of pools,my marth is nightmare fuel,hard wen u can't read,NIKITA

beat me on NA,especially not now,my raigon is god tier,?,you've never taken a game on NA,u asked for 300 rematches,but we only played 2 or 3 matches,no..,there was a 5-2 game, that was as close as u got,even vs raigon i won 5-4,and that's pre-buff,im not a liar,find it in odeum,or find discord link of us talking about it,it doesn't exist,lol,that works too,idk if the vods are up, but they might be,comb through if ur really sure,but im 100%,u didnt win a game,if u won a game on NA, i'd consider you top tier practice and I would've played u more the other times u asked,that's the truth,i don't play u on NA cause it's a waste of time,u miss ez shit cus of lag and i crush u,same for u vs me on EU,well i took an addy an hour ago,im awake enough,nikita,wanna 1v1,my smurf got to too high of ELO

the money verosk,ty based jamie,im v poor,and also a degen gambling addict,so i appreciate it,won so much money in poker before,lost it through gay loophole,never again,i ONLY profit,i live for the profit,basically site got bought out by another site, they had a refractory period where if you made an account with the new site they'd give you a credit for your money amount, but if you exceeded the date it was like no refunds get fucked,i wasn't aware of the date, randomly went to play poker after a couple months,2 grand gone,nah, bovada,bought out by ignition,they used to be one of the 2 premiere NA online sites,but they upped the raking,and downgraded software,ACR is where it's at now,made an account there yesterday,im an insane player,lol,i studied poker for years,i've never lost money playing in person,online's a lot harder,but it's still doable,poker was like,one of my passions,like soccer and gaming,i was DEEP into it,i've always been good at it,ya so,u just outplay them,with ur 9 inch,shifu main,LUL,i'll have u know im a raigon main,named shifu,implying jack is older than 17,ok brb to do yardwork gay,blcfangay,wow,it was way closer to done that i remembered,i worked my ass off yesterday,finished the rest of the work in 15 minutes,o i just did a ton of yardwork yesterday,so much that i didn't finish it cus i was tired,went to finish it just now,thought it'd take a while,took 15 minutes,cus i went ham yesterday,had to rake the rest of the side of my house,and bag leaves and shit,cus we're planting new grass,quitting a game i already enjoyed when it's only had good patches lately,🤔,the only time i didn't have fun in this game was when i felt shifu was overrated, and after his nerf,all my concerns have to do with balance, since im sick as fuck and like to compete and win always,if the balance is good i have no complaints rly,it still isn't good,but it's the best it's been in a while,all i do is open up runescape,see my,"51 days of member credit remaining",locate the cannonballs,place the cannonballs,i only have a pure,and my prayer got fucked up by a hacker,but it's pretty dece,real talk, im kinda bad at pking so i spend more time farming guap than i do farming stats,cus fk,ya but weren't u a bottrash,for the big dollars,,hm,can't see stats that well,67 str, 78 range, 84 smithing,1 def ofc,nothing super worth noting except the super

dont rly,cus the money's 3rd best in the game or smth,was 2nd,no,i just make pures and PK,24/7,never fucked with dmm,SLS game design,just sit outside the map,throw bakko axes,reset axes with R,they turn into eggs,and do 10x as much damage,???,i just realized something,for dodgeball to be fun,u have to not slow down while shooting,experimenting with not slowing down while shooting <:PogChamp:282891715810033665>,memes have productive purpose <:PogChamp:282891715810033665>,i saw a vid yesterday,of some guy with fucking dharoks or whatever,pking with 1 hp,via injuring himself,guy says "try to 1shot me",get hits for 98,dies,it was SO troll,ya but osrs doesn't have godsword right,or does it,o,i couldn't remember exactly where the cutoff was,cus there's like, no dclaws,and stuff,but they were so broken,y add them back lol,so many people complained,u guys are silly,keep in mind the game has never been f2p for more than 2 days at a time,with a whole week, personally ik a lot of people that'll play,also fucking LOL,be awake 26 hours, sleep for 2 hours,thanks adderall,16k being broken is impossible,they had the streamer/youtuber/initial hype train back then,everyone who wanted to try the game badly tried it then,when, sadly, it was much worse,we'll see how player retention looks this time,i'm pretty optimistic,if we can retain 20% of the new players that play,it'll be enough for F2P launch,real talk,cus there's gonna be a HUGE spike,assuming BR is purely free with only cosmetic microtransactions, it's near the absolute top of games,like, it's a top 5 f2p game easily,^,i agree with u,u won't see like, rocket league numbers,of 300k,but 40 or 50k, with streamer support,who knows,im looking forward to the tourneys,i can show off to the world how crazy good i am,so fun,zzz, i nearly need to buy another smurf account,i want to stay practiced,and queues are long on my smurf now,91% raigon winrate, not bad tho,it should be 96,played my first game of the day against jumong/oldur with a plat 8,lost 3-0,worst part is, i smashed the same 2 players the next 5 or 6 games in a row,just needed a warmup,ya i remember fizzi,that's another thing,we'll have to see that too, it's the most important factor nobody's really talking about cus there's no info,striking the balance with f2p pay models is the hardest part,having shit people want to buy, but not making people feel like they're forced to buy,right now, i worry that the only people who spend money will spend it on champs and not cosmetics,tbh, the game needs a full graphical overhaul (including all skins) before release. Seems like it's in the works for the worst offenders,but if you want people to spend money on chests,ya but that's a big issue,cosmetics are the money maker,with no money being spent in a f2p game, the game will die.,SLS can't run on fumes,i worry that the community will be there who appreciates the game,but nobody will deem the f2p optional spending worth it,SNOWFLAKE,H A T,H A T,H A T,dude im

money,hello?,hello where is ur brain,u were like "HEH, i bet he's implying he got paid by SLS am i right?",and everyone is like "yeah that's the joke.",sodapoppin doesn't have friends,rofl,sodapoppin more unlikable than me,because he's literally me,but dumber,and less talented,and WAY richer,<:blop:301110923823677450>,,witness TRUE autism,my irl friend at the bottom of the thread,"wobbling isn't even good",im fuckin dying,ya,it gets more and more autistic,the further you go,its the abyss,wobbling is soooooooooo great,anyone who dislikes it is mad gay,i mean, i've lost games in tourney before to getting wobbled 3 of my 4 stocks at 2%,but that's ur fault for playing bad neutral,still win the set,lol,ROFL,ur joking right,u dont need to smash di downthrow dair,you can JUST hold cstick out,that's literally it,no joke,and top 10 players still get caught by it 10 times in one set,in ONE set,like are you kidding me,ya,im 100% sure,lol,im friends with a LOT of top 100 players,all they do is rage,about people not DIing out,lol,they're literally,just misinformed,play on instinct and experience,dont research game,at all,lol,,<:feelsSomethingman:285783203913138187>,forever ago,literally,2-3 months after game's release,i wouldn't say competitive,there was no competiton for me,i was the best by so much that i quit,lol,nowadays, players are way better than i ever was,way way better,hansa, i did,for 3-4 months,after i was bored beyond belief,there was no money in the scene,0 dollars,i mean ZERO dollars,no tournaments whatsoever on anything except ps3,and that went on for months,Like, I played an average of 15 hours a day,for the first 6 months or so of the game being out,even though i wasnt having any fun,since every game was 10-0,because i wanted to remain good, for when there was eventually money in the scene,and the money just never came,lol,Of course, like 3-4 months after i finally gave in and quit,rocket league became an esport,but i was actually so burnt out and hated the game so much from forcing myself to play, i couldn't go back,ya, there was a 50,000 lan,it's a tier 3 esport,or tier 2,I like tried to go back once i heard there was money,but i just couldn't,hated the game soooooooo much,i've never had less fun in a game than i had playing RL after i burnt out,it's my own fault for playing so much and not quitting when i wanted a break,but i wanted to be the best so what can i do,zzz,ya lol,t3 esport is like 100k+ per year,t2 is like 1m+,t1 is like 5m+,iirc,Yep.,There about 10 times as many RL tourneys as there are for BR,plus tons of lans,and other big online sponsored tourneys,with pro analysts and commentators and shit,it's pretty e-sports,there's even coaches,10 times as many tournaments and way more than 10 times as much money lol,probably like 200 times as much money,but like BR, the best players compete in everything, even the small weeklies and stuff,so winning any of them is impossible,Like a team that formed like 3 months after i quit JUST had their first loss,like last week,Waking up LUL,guess,:3,ya,we won 10-1,5-1 5-0,we played kinda sloppy,we lost 3 PRL's ago,and again, i wasn't home.,It doesn't even count as a loss.,As far as i'm concerned, we're still undefeated.,When you lose game 3 5-4, it's hardly a loss,We mirrored them the next week, Croak/oldur/ashka,and won,then the week after we played croak/jumong/oldur,and won again,we can play basically whatever we want now,and consistently win,im basedgod,ty based god,aka me,u mean meth,flowing in my veins,M E T H,found nyy,,wasted potential is the nyy special,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvqjAxUO6HQ,game should have 9 million player peak,Kreygasm,wtf,pog,lol holy shit,i posted an odeum clip of a crazy shifu 1v2 i did on stream,like actually insane,it's been 24 hours and it got 100 likes and 20 reposts,wtf,dude,that's the most i think i've ever seen on a play,wasn't expecting that many,it's pretty crazy tho,i was 1hp for the entire thing,79 does = 100,same shit,x = owo,helo corrodor,corrdoed,o/,<@226719375183446016>,ya who cares,regardless of the elo i played perfectly,ofc they have to play like shit,to lose a 1v2 against a 1hp shifu,post-nerf,as raigon/rk,lol,:meme:,god man,no matter how many times i see teldo's face,i somehow manage to dislike him more than the last,every time,no,i wouldn't,we have such conflicting personalities we wouldn't be able to team in the first place,lol,he'd call me toxic, i'd call him a crybaby who whines about his broken character,we'd HATE eachother,yeah,but unlike xanax,we're predispositioned to hating eachother already,lol,the first words out of either of our mouths would be insults,dont ask me why, he's the one who said i was a toxic dumbass and permabanned me from his stream before i even met him,literally hadn't MET him,never spoken once,to him,still to this day,ya, but anyone who pre-judges me just because im known to be toxic won't ever be forgiven from me,i have a saying,if you think im toxic,i'll prove you right,im only toxic towards people i don't like,and i only don't like people who think im toxic,ya get it,he's a grimeball shitbag,fuck em,americans aren't like europeans, we're way too prideful to ever forgive anyone for anything,i'll hold a grudge against teldo for the next 17 years,for literally NO reason,just because i can,see you're too forgiving,he's neither a good player OR a good personality,i can't really speak on his personality except for my very little experience with him, so maybe he's a nice guy,but he's DEFINITELY not a good player,if we ever played, i'd rape him so bad he'd quit,he's a third rate player in a second rate region,please,besides, im the kind of guy who doesn't care if you're extremely toxic or extremely nice. I treat everyone equally and ignore personality because I know how it feels to be singled out because of a brash personality.,Whether he's a nice guy or not means nothing,nah,we almost disbanded because of a mutual hatred of eachother,which is a valid reason to disband,but then we made up and it's whatever,but don't get the wrong idea, we only made up because it's the best logical choice for our team, for our sponsor, etc etc,If he was anyone else i would've told him to fuck off and die and he would've said the same,and i would've left it at that,there's few things more important than my pride, but winning is one of them,plus, averse and i used to be friends before we got into this huge fight, and I don't particularly like giving up friends even for the sake of my pride,im way too cool,to get a better attitude,my self esteem is high,my ego is higher,i have to win because winning is what i was born to do,there's no reason,it's just who i am,i've felt that way for LITERALLY my entire life,since i was like 7 or 8 years old. As long as I can remember,i've felt like i was immensely talented at everything and had the potential to be better than everyone else if i feel like it,and in almost everything, it's true,i don't really think that im superior to anyone else, i just work harder and i happen to be kind of talented for whatever reason. But I've always felt that "I should win no matter what" mentality,^ wtf LOL,verosk why are u even trying to convince me i'd like teldo,what makes u think me and teldo would even WANT to get along,let me rephrase, maybe teldo wants to be friends with me,why would i ever want to be friends with teldo,or teammates,or anything,in my eyes, he's worthless,and i dont care for his personality,i can't think of a single thing i like about him,nothing,no,averse is,lol,averse with his 90% winrate on his smurf,90%,Im at like 88% right now on my smurf and im in the middle of champ,the queue times are just gay,nah,u only face diamond/champs,it's rly gay,nikita ur mechanical genius,u probably could,ya,ur mechanics are VERY swag,VERY swag nikita,abusing games is the key to winning in literally any game,mechanical skill is only half the game,the other half is cheesing and playing like a fucking faggot,i respect it,LoL is very fun,i played it for 4 years,like most people did,but LoL was my secondary game behind blazblue,I played blazblue about 12 hours a day and LoL maybe 3-6,for like 4 or 5 years,some days i'd get burnt out on BB and just play league,but not that often,league's actually tough now,good players are good,like, diamond 1+,the players are tough,me and a lot of my former diamond 1/challenger friends went back to the game,and even getting to like mid diamond is pretty rough now,but we might just be rusty,idk,of course,but we were super SUPER mechanically skilled,like, way higher than pro players in LCS and stuff,and people seem like they can almost keep up now,nah, we were,i killed so many pro players level 1 or 2 in lane,by just outplaying them with better movement and positioning,lol,but you'll never get picked up by a pro team playing a hypercarry you can do a laneswap against, or camp really hard against, or shut down with malphite or nasus, like tryndamere which is what i mained.,Similarly, im a one trick, so that never works in comp either,you'll just get banned out,but mechanically on trynd i was wayyyyyy above pro players,ya it's a neverending meme that people think trynd takes more skill,he's up there with zed and riven with crit storing and ani cancelling and optimal fury management and striking a good balance of fury gen/ lane freezing,he's actually pretty tough to play at the very highest level,trynd has a lot of mechanical tricks as well,with animation cancelling,for example, if you hit Q during your critical hit animation, you'll consume your fury and be at 0% crit chance and still crit on the next hit, which generates 3 times as much fury as a normal auto,you can also like critE at the same time in one animation and all the damage shows as one hit instead of multiple, so you can't flash out of the burst or anything,the biggest mechanical thing with trynd was when you're harassing under tower getting auto > autoE away from tower and having all 3 hit AND not being in tower range by the time it shoots, by timing it to the rhythm of the tower's autos,there were lots of little things. Obviously just trading melee autos with people and either forcing them to cancel their auto animation 80% of the way in by moving away first or having them auto-follow you into your minions to land the auto too,like riven vs trynd stuff,I shit on all of them,lol,hao, rohammerz, etc,haoz, rohammers*,both got raped by me 1v1 and in solo queue,i was pretty well known,he was pretty good at AD trynd before that,AP trynd was soooooooooo fun,and broken,lol,runescape Kreygasm,if u think im not steady farming cannonballs,ur wrong,ya,,i played a lot of RS back in the day,u just lure people with whip right?,u have whip,retard sees whip,lure into wildy, kill,ez cash,i was a master of the scum lure tactics,i used my socioeconomics™,to lure small children into the wild,and kill them,LOL,and then u smite,right?,LOL,pffffffffffffff,f,f,f,f,f,f,f,f,f,smite for good measure,gotta get that max value,ya, i dont have my main anymore,i only have my gmaul dbow cheese pure,so much rangers guild training,78 range 67 hp,lol,i still have to do monkey sadness,monkey sadness,u never answered the question about teldo btw,why even bring him up,-_-,im surprised u can defend him,i mean, there's a bond between teammates and since ur teammates ur somewhat inclined to defend him,at the same time, i didnt defend averse and averse didn't defend me when we disliked eachother,how can u like him,nikita <:PogChamp:282891715810033665>,like im sure there were some people who liked hitler,he's not rly likable,well i do,and im always right,ssssssssssssssswag,u always go stun parry,in each and every MU on raigon,im the best player of him, so trust me,raigon's Q goes from one of the worst ability in the game to the single strongest ability in the game with that rite,there's no time you don't take it,it's not even that,it's the insane radius + stealth revealing + interrupt + the fact that you can't interrupt raigon,it's absurdly strong,it interrupts everything and is impossible to interrupt itself,The amount of times croak has stealthed,and I Q > hold > C Q > see 6 damage > R > m2 > R > ExE > exm1 > Space m1 m1,rip croak/jade players,dead from full hp,in stealth,raigon doesn't give a fuck about anything,the game even makes that "DING" sound when your R wall stuns,so you know exactly when it works and when it doesn't,he's absurdly strong,my highest winrate was pre-nerf shifu at around 68%,My raigon winrate is 90%,enough said,nothing stops him except jumong/oldur, which as always beat everything,ya, everyone suffers vs them tho,melees can't catch them, ranged can't escape them,mobility is a powerful tool,jade's space is just a ridiculously gay tool,it even beats raigon's Q when nothing else in the game does,can't anti-stealth with ur Q like u can with croak,cus she just spaces and it's radius is like bigger than bakko's space,shit's insane,the e recast rite might be decent against a jade/double range combo,but u never take it except then,it's not unsatisfying as much as it is impossible,i've had 1v1's where jade is 20 hp and i'm 180,and jade kills me,she's fucking nuts vs raigon,u can't even hit her,she has 20 ways to get out of melee range, and if u try to engage with exe she reaction E's you out of it,she's actually cancer,you'd have to like ExE cancelcast Q her silence back into her ExE her while she's silenced,only possible way to engage,or catch her randomly with an E in stealth,which is borderline impossible,lol,mfw i fight against jade,,YUNG arakune,teldo hosting finlev,reason # 47378229 to dislike teldo,swag,for the new hitler's reign,ofc,nah,pest counters every champion in the game,but he's raigfon's number 1 counter,lol,raigon*,it's more like "champ 4 player on a slightly better champion counters diamond 6 poloma",I had gold score at the time of my death every time,making so few mistakes,lol,i didnt charge at all,got 2v1'd nonstop,while sitting back,croak's bad rn,worse than raigon, at least.,so,idk, it's weird,croak still has the utility he used to have,but he's much much weaker,i dont think he's top 2 melee anymore,i wish that all of u didn't talk so much so I could actually write my thoughts on croak in a concise way where they won't just become part of the wall of text.,cus my opinion on croak is right, and it's that he's not op but appears op,cus he's unique,he's the strongest champion in the game when his teammate is alive, and probably one of the weakest solo champions. In particular for 1v2ing he's atrocious now. It's impossible, even if your opponent is as low as 25 health there's no possible way to kill them and win a 1v2.,He's also pretty bad at peeling, meaning if they ignore you (somehow) and kill your teammate, the round is instantly over,this isn't true for champs like shifu, raigon, and oldur, with game changing ultimates,we're talking about croak,croak can't both apply pressure with deceit and peel with it. You can only engage or counterengage. He simply doesn't have the mobility while stealthed to do both.,Ultimately, I think croak is actually fairly weak in solo queue, but he's about as good as your teammates are mechanically. If you have super solid teammates who are good at staying alive and not getting bursted, croak is good because he enables his teammates more than any other melee with the cds he burns and the combos he sets up. But if you're EVER at a disadvantage with croak player wise the round is instantly over, since he can't do anything when outnumbered.,So he's mostly not worth playing in tournament either.,You can't carry on croak, or outplay really.,I've given my opinion, and I'm the best croak so i'm right.,He's still good enough to win tournaments against players worse than you, but so are most champs in the game.,I mean, im not some teldo ripoff because im not playing croak anymore.,I actually think he's not the best choice in tourneys or solo queue,Raigon.,Raigon is world destroyer status,he's stronger than croak ever was,he's capable of 1v2ing people from full health,FULL health,he's probably even stronger than peak shifu was,he's really good,lol,nah, shifu was too ccable,you can't cc raigon,since you're constantly cc'd yourself,as soon as you try to hit raigon you take a 120 damage combo,since when have i ever been like teldo,im not that nice,as always, my word is law and everything i say is a fact,there's no room for argument,damn right,raigon only has one weakness. And his name is pestilus,pestilus has plenty of other weaknesses though, so if you build a comp that's good against pest,nothing beats raigon anymore,raigon does more damage, heals more, chases and escapes equally well,and he ccs harder,the only thing raigon has that croak doesn't is stealth, and he's stronger in every other possible way,why would u use stealth,when you can dive in 1v3 and kill someone,by yourself,nah, im talking against project horizon,u wanna risk ur snipe getting reflected by raigon or oldur?,u can never m2,then gl ever getting mid,lol,what u play has nothing to do with how good it is,i played croak in finals of tourney 2 weeks ago and we won with it,and the whole time i felt like it was bad,that's why i switched to raigon the following week,ur just wrong, our results say raigon's better too,we've yet to lose more than 2 rounds in any tournament match with raigon,and we're back to our old form of 5-0ing about 80% of our matches,we even 5-0'd game 2 of grand finals,where we were against pest AND freya AND croak,all super good against raigon apparently,except he destroys everything,cus he's raigon,there's only 2 possible scenarios here. Either raigon is as strong as he's saying I am, or i'm so much better than my opponents that im turning them into paste with a worse character.,To be honest with you, option 1 is more likely.,Especially against project horizon,raigon is the safer pick,doesn't rely on mindgaming people to start combos,he hits Q and you die,even if you cc him out of the Q with freya stun or something,he STILL combos you,with the recast,raigon doesn't give a fuck,if you're ever near a wall at any point in the match, half your health is gone,if raigon's teammates are there, 100% is gone,he's that strong,u legit can't even play the game against him, he's straight up unfair,lol,lost?,when?,oh, ya,we typically lose round 1 or 2 with raigon,he only gets stronger as time goes on,round 4 is when he becomes broken tier,croak WAS more viable than raigon,but you have to understand the meta has an impact as well, even if croak's kit is as strong as raigon's, Raigon demolishes croak 1v1 and they're both frontliners so they're gonna run into eachother,If I just sit back next to my ranged and let oldur peel for himself, croak can do nothing.,Because your Q gives you stealth vision,And then you combo him in stealth off of it,You hit Q, hold it for an arbitrary middling amount of time, then cancel and instantly recast. If it doesn't hit him, he won't be in range to incap you, if it does hit him, you combo him,raigon's broken right now because of the numbers,if his M2 hits 2 people, it does 33 damage and heals 33,that shit is NOT ok,No, because you're sitting inside your teammates constantly as raigon,and you still have your EXE as a long ranged deceit initiate,if you hit your EXE, your teammates (ashka, oldur, whoever) can follow up like a deceit,and then you walk up to them slowly and wall combo them at the end,raigon doesn't go in ideally, he camps next to the ranged and lets the healer fend for himself. With raigon's peel, nobody can touch your ranged champion ever,The thing is raigon is so overloaded that if you can land a 2 man m2, you can actually just go into 3 people by yourself,you won't take any damage,and they will,god forbid you hit Q when they try to focus you,Q again r combo,etc,what are you gonna do, not hit the raigon who's inside 3 of you? you have no choice,but hitting raigon means you die,lol,i can play any champion in any playstyle, anyone good can,with some practice,raigon's playstyle is unique, he has a playstyle nobody else in the game has,and that's literally "do whatever i want whenever i want",nobody can ever stop raigon,in any situation,no matter what he does,the only way raigon loses is by misplaying with his Q or space horribly and being out of position, or his teammates getting killed when he becomes too aggressive,you can't actually kill raigon. He's invincible.,like i said, he can 2v1 oldur/jumong from full hp if you're better than them by a bit,the strongest 2v2 comp,so lol,raigon only uses his space to escape xaynox,so that line doesn't exist,unless he's using it to chase someone like a jade who jumped out after getting combod for 90%,those are the 2 scenarios,it's not an initaite,initiate*,if you initiate with raigon's space he's like the worst champ in the game. You just throw oldur E or freya stun at him or something and he dies,lol,u have to save raigon's m2 for healing to win trades, so you can't use it at the start of an engagement,that's something i picked up from all my time playing shifu,meaning if you space in and use your M2 to dodge an ashka Q, it's very unlikely you can dodge the ashka Q AND someone's gonna be at the right distance for you to hit them,so now you have 5 seconds with 0 cds, and you didnt get any value out of either ability,dead,if u use ur R to dodge with raigon, he's useless,most of the time, you can just ex1 in people's faces and tank the damage.,You only save your R to be aggressive,in raigon's case, the more people who focus him the stronger he is,it's the ideal scenario for a melee,everything he does is AOE,raigon also happens to be a god of 1v1 though,raigon has deceit on a ranged ability,the best part is, he doesn't even need to use it to initiate,cus he can use his m2,no, the answer is definitely raigon,raigon has 2 bad matchups in the entire game. Jumong and pestilus.,Croak loses to shifu, pestilus, oldur, jumong, raigon, and ezmo,on top of that, every matchup raigon doesn't lose, he smashes,croak has a lot of "even" matchups where the better player wins,raigon's winning matchups are hulk smashes,where you have a 0% chance of survival,are u saying he doesn't?,lol,again, im the best croak,so my opinion on this > yours,additionally we have the best jumong player,so,croak lost to jumong even before any of the nerfs,it was always his hardest matchup.,i can't be wrong because im me and im never wrong,i've been proven wrong approx 0 times in history,so,i said we should get 100% of runes,which isn't wrong,we just didn't execute,he does.,You're probably just worse than teldo on your jumong so you feel that way,that's the truth,my jumong would crush any croak on earth,so,well,my teammates aren't me,i can't rely on them to do anything,if it was 3 of me on the same team, we'd have gotten 100% of runes,and we'd never lose a round,ever,dude if i had 3 of me on one team,i think i'd maintain 100% winrate for like,at least 300 games,before i lost one,that's probably true for ninjas and averse too tho,hmmmmmm,i wonder why we're worse on a team,than we'd be on our own,🤔,<:feelsnikitaman:284752940290539531>,nikita knows what im talking about,a team with nikita 3 times would smash everyone in EU,cus his mechanical skill and game knowledge are so much higher,well the point is,raigon is better than croak right now,i'd ask someone to prove me wrong, but we all know that won't happen since 1. im always right and 2. even if i wasn't nobody's good enough to prove me wrong,besides,raigon will get nerfed next patch,so it doesn't matter,he's the strongest any melee has ever been in this game,of course,i win every tournament with him,what kind of question is that,it's like u dont watch me 10-1 every finals,and the 1 loss is when averse tries to kill himself,cus he's messaging his gf in discord,instead of playing the game,averse told me the other day,he doesn't even keep track of cds anymore,says he doesn't need to,none of us even try anymore,lol,we just sit in the discord call and meme and troll eachother, like when i kept using raigon's E to make his jumong ults miss,did it like 3 times last night in grand finals,was laughing at him every time,won 10-1 anyway,lol,no, he's not,oldur is,but raigon might actually be 2nd,i think it's the first time a melee's been 2nd place or better tho,since the freya thing,shifu was like, 3rd or 4th at one point,but he was never better than jumong/taya/croak on their respective patches,i've always said that,he was also worse than poloma and arguably varesh back then,so maybe he was like 4th,btw every team we play against now that wins rounds,is playing raigon,but we beat them,with our raigon,oldur's been the best champ in the game,averse and ninjas agreed with me and oldur is, quote, "the strongest any support has ever been on any patch in this game",I asked them that exact question and they both responded with a blunt "yes",He's absurdly strong,no, oldur was the best champ when we mirrored project horizon's comp with my day 2 croak and ninjas' day 2 oldur,and we smashed them in grand finals,with their own comp,lol,raigon was the best champ in the game since I said he was,and im always right,i've been saying that since before we won with him,well, not best champ,2nd behind oldur,but definitely best melee,I mean since when has the tier list gone 
#1 Support
#2 melee
#3 ranged,like,a ranged ISNT the best character,since when,how long has it been,lol,literally,it's literally been that long,like 6 months,it was poloma, then jumong, then taya, then poloma again, now oldur,melee's never been on that top tier life,croak was 2nd best, maybe 3rd,zab, u can't be so passionate about defending ur character. It just comes off at biased whether you're right or not. Which you are btw.,I'm saying you care too much about convincing them. You can't convince these people even with results. I've been trying for like 45 minutes.,here we go again,LOL,have pest on ur team vs a diamond every game,makes it a lot easier,im playing perfect,3 golds except healing every round,and we're getting smashed,cus my teammate can't secure a mid orb,or land a m2,zzzz,fizz ur a shit player,dont speak,thx,ur speaking,when i just told u not to,i'm a god,you're a man,u should understand the difference,but i guess you can't,Everything I say is right.,You lack the mental capacity to see things from my point of view, so you ignorantly disagree.,It isn't really your fault, you were born that way.,why would i ever be responsible for anything?,I currently and have always done everything I want to do, whenever I want to do it.,That will never change.,You're living a suboptimal lifestyle.,That's overrated. I've been prepared for my entire life since the day I was born.,Why are you spending time preparing,You weren't born ready?,Anything that i don't anticipate or don't know how to solve, I'll learn to solve in a matter of minutes.,It's what it means to be me.,I think people love me? I've never thought that. I'm hated by people inferior to me and their opinions mean nothing, because they're worthless in and of themselves.,You must think i'm a lot nicer than I am.,The truth of the matter is, I've never cared about the opinions of anyone except me.,Because i'm always right.,Nah, plenty of people enjoy the way I am.,I say things plenty of people think.,Not everything is a neverending ego trip like people like fizz think.,I'm a mostly normal guy.,you're reaching. That shit was ages ago,Do you really hate me that much?,Deflect blame? act toxic to my teammates?,I treat both of them fine,I don't blame anyone unless they're at fault.,Why wouldn't I,have you seen me,,does this look like the face,of someone who gives a fuck about anything or anyone else,ooo, big scary therapist words.,Well, for your information, I've consulted a handful of mental health professionals, and I've specifically asked whether I'm a socio, narc, etc etc. The whole list.,I have no personality OR mental disorders.,I'm just extremely cocky.,Thinking i'm better than you doesn't make me a narcissist even though that's what the text book definition of a narcissist is, do you know why?,Because the definition of a narcissist implies that it's unjust and delusional.,I simply am better than you.,Actually am.,It isn't delusional, I don't have a mental disorder. I'm stating a fact.,Do you get it now? Probably not.,I'm exceptionally good at everything. It isn't just gaming.,Gaming's just something I enjoy doing.,? I was the most talented at soccer and swimming of my 6 brothers. 2 of my brothers played on the FL state team and one of my half brothers was 2nd in the state swimming,I quit them because I didn't find them fun.,I also got the best grades and have the highest IQ of anyone in my family,This isn't delusion, it's a fact,lol,Considering the immense level of talent I was born with, it's not a stretch to say I'm actually fairly modest.,You just can't understand.,Because we're different.,What's bullshit about it?,I've said it time and time again,if you think im not as good as I say, prove me wrong,Nobody ever does it.,There's a reason. I'm not delusional and there's no mental disorder. I'm everything I say I am.,The "God" part is figurative,but the rest is literally true.,What, so you're going to sit here and make claims you can't back up, and then when I counter them with fact you're going to ignore me and try to end the conversation?,You're a weak minded person.,To clarify fizz, I consider all sorts of different people to have different "levels" of worth and talent and shit. Something you should understand is that i'm at the absolute top of the food chain.,There's nobody above me,But you? You aren't even the tier below me,or the tier below that,or the tier below that,You're one of those people where i question why you're even allowed in this discord,since it's supposed to be for people of a certain skill,or "value" in this case,that you aren't at,and won't ever be at,The same reason I'm here after all the shit I talk is the same reason you shouldn't be here,Raigon is better than croak, idiots.,We already talked about this.,I've wasted enough time on it.,I'm gonna just start phrasing my opinions that way instead. Trying to be nice and have civil conversations and convince people i'm right is a waste of time and effort.,If you can't see, you won't ever see.,Raigon is better than solo queue in all ways.,Than croak*,in all ways.,Including solo queue.,I'll say it one time in a blunt way you can't misunderstand. There are 0 things croak does better than raigon.,0.,<@227161493227962370> he was shit a month ago and got buffed, so your prediction is irrelevant. Unless you predicted him getting buffed, which any idiot could've seen coming.,Point is, raigon's popular because of a buff. Not because of whatever reason you thought he'd become popular for.,I like raigon more than any other champ and I didn't play him a month ago cause he was unviable.,?,His buffs made him trade better than shifu,that was all he needed to become broken,You're incorrect again.,Stealth is easier to counterplay than Raigon's Q. Which has literally 0 counterplay in the whole game even if you can see him.,easier.*,easier*,easier*,ffs,it lasts long enough to beat most iframes and still hit with the 2nd hit, it beats all counters, directional shields, and you can't interrupt him to stop him from using it,no counterplay exists,there's only counterplay to 1 of raigon's abilities, and it's his m2,it's why i've been losing to finlev tonight,he's consistently Eing me out of my m2, or spacing, and it's going on CD whilst doing 0 damage,It's something I haven't seen much before.,Well, i've been watching the reddit pretty closely,and everyone still considers raigon a tier 2 melee, and freya/croak tier 1,if either freya or croak get nerfed, or raigon gets buffed, he'll be the best champ in the game.,That much is certain,freya and oldur are the only champs that sort of keep raigon in check,you know something's wrong when raigon destroys jumong,Of course. She's a counter melee and you need to save your space to escape.,Even with a healer, freya will beat raigon.,Im saying mirror comps,with healers,the thing is croak becomes stronger when his teammates are around, but raigon is the same,and raigon's solo game is much much stronger,both for 1v1 and 1v2,What dont you get.,1v1 and 1v2 situations happen in tournaments.,I'm obviously talking about tournaments.,I told you already, raigon does literally 0 things worse than croak,so obviously he crushes him in solo queue too,he wins in A L L scenarios,raigon will crush them,He acts as a moving oldur bubble, which since you already have an oldur means jade can never m2 off raigon's combos,croak's combos*,meanwhile, jade raigon is one of the best combos in the entire game,better than croak/jade for sure,even ignoring the oldur,stealth is countered by raigon's Q,it is,How do you want me to convince you,I explained how he's better already,0 3's experience,except winning every 3's tournament since the game launched,lol,The competition isn't that weak. Other EU teams normally don't make it grands. They always fall to project horizon here. Which is the same as EU where horizon has been dominating the last few weeks.,And besides, last week project horizon lost to an NA team and got 3rd, the team that beat them last week lost round 1 this week to a different team that we beat 10-0.,This week, project horizon got 2nd, but the semifinal went to game 3, round 9.,5-4.,The NA teams can nearly beat project horizon,and project horizon is even good in EU,so NA isn't so bad,im tired of this 140 ping shit. None of them play on 140 ping.,They play on like 110 at the most.,they don't win tournaments,Project horizon ever beating us is impossible.,They won't win a single tournament until my heart stops beating,that should be made 100% clear,Project horizon ever beating us is impossible.,They won't win a single tournament until my heart stops beating,ya same,discord servers rip'd for a second there,we're back,im sick of this,don't sit here with your "project horizon wins tournaments on NA ping, must be better than NA" shit,you know as well as i do how full of shit you are,they won one tournament out of 14 attempts, by one round, when I wasn't at home on a different pc.,On top of that, their 110 ping isn't even that big of a disadvantage with their braindead 12 second cc comp. Especially when you consider me and averse are both on 70 ping.,they won one tournament out of 14 attempts, by one round, when I wasn't at home on a different pc.,On top of that, their 110 ping isn't even that big of a disadvantage with their braindead 12 second cc comp. Especially when you consider me and averse are both on 70 ping.,"b-but they have 40 more ping than you on an easier to execute, more op comp!",tough fuckin shit,they lose every time,i don't CARE why they lose,and their one "win" was a fluke,it will N E V E R,happen again,as long as im fuckin alive,We'd crush every EU team,it was more uncertain 2 months ago, there's no question now.,We'd win 10-1 or 10-2 like we do every match now.,there's absolutely 0 doubt in my mind.,I'm so sure in fact, that when the time comes that there's a LAN,i'll bet 5000 of my own dollars,on us winning,with whoever wants to take it,im /positive/,im certain we'll win,im so confident in our team,that i'm even certain we'll be the #1 team after free to play,when there's 20x as many players,we won't ever lose,ever,there's no humans alive that are capable of beating our team,we're the 3 best players in history, and we're on one team.,it's some generation of miracles shit,2 years from now, we'll still win everything,it doesn't matter how many people try to beat us or how many times they try, nobody will ever succeed,on LAN or online,with any comp,we're unbeatable,well, that's only as long as averse doesn't quit. He's been burning out lately like I did a couple months ago,If anyone of the 3 players on our team quit, we have a chance of losing,but for now it's 0%,Mentality has 0 impact on the outcome of a match.,I've been negative, toxic, whiny, and I've been extremely egotistical and confident,no matter my attitude, I always win in everything I do.,skill is all that matters,confidence is like... courage y'know, like how some people ask boxers "how can you get in the ring and not be afraid of the guy standing in front of you",you're born with it or you aren't,it's something you just have,I do understand zab,you're saying my confidence is part of the reason we win,but im saying it isn't. Even when i'm unsure or think we might lose, we win.,even when i play bad or my teammates tilt me, we win,no matter the circumstances we win,well, both of my teammates are insecure af. Like low self-esteem,I carry the team's morale,and sometimes im in a SHIT mood and dont even want to play,and i just tell them to stfu and dont comms,and we still win,whatever happens, we win,thats cus i've trained ninjas in like 6 months with all the lessons i learned through 7 years of trial and error through competitive gaming,if anything, he'll be the one to surpass me,cus i tried to teach him everything i could so he'd be as good as possible,never thought he'd be this good of a player tho,he's insane,reminds me of me,we only play aggressive because we're certain we can outplay,you think im against playing defensively, or they are?,we don't mind it,we just try to end the games quick so we can go to sleep,you underestimate how little threat we feel,lol,i don't think any of us have even considered that losing is possible, even when we drop games and it looks close,tbh, i agree,there's no reason for anyone else to play except us,we're too strong,once u play against us on even footing, you're sure to feel the despair im talking about,there's no chance,there never was one,won't ever be one,anything anyone else does we can do better,even without practicing,we're the strongest players,if a comp is so broken it can't be beaten, we'll simply play it and beat whoever mains those chars with their own comp,the chance of us losing is always 0%,so?,there's thousands of f2p players we haven't faced yet,just like there's eu teams,i mean once the game is f2p wing,not this week,lol,?,i told you, we will never have good competition,be it a month, a year, 10 years,nobody will ever stop us,the loss is a onetime fluke due to an unfortunate circumstance AND us trying to stick with a comp that was no longer viable.,Which was a mistake on our part,besides, it had been months of us not practicing before that loss. Now we've started putting in a TINY bit of effort (just me actually, ninjas and averse are basically still afk) and we've gone back to 10-0ing everyone,if we all tried our hardest, which we likely never will have to, we won't lose,even if a team that appears as good as us appears during f2p or something,we'll just practice a ton,and crush them,you gotta understand we're putting in probably 10% of the effort we're capable of putting in right now,and we still look this strong,now does that mean with 100% effort we'd be 10 times better? of course not,but we'd certainly be a lot better,again, we're on some generation of miracles shit. We're so strong that if we try as hard as we can i'm sure our opponents will give up without even trying to beat us,they'll see how futile it is,that happened to PH on wednesday,after the 5-1 game 1, they changed 2 champs so they could "go to bed faster",that's literally what they said,there's no chance,my irl friend jeff is among that talent too,but i've met very few people with the same gaming ability as me,the fact that it's only jeff, averse, and ninjas,and 3 of those people are on one team,is just unfair,it's actually not fair,and i knew that when jeff quit, as soon as i picked up averse,i knew we'd be unstoppable,No mental or psychological disorder. It's simply overwhelming confidence.,No, you have it wrong zab. You need a team with comparable skill,just. Skill.,There isn't one,we're only able to be aggressive because we're better,against an equally skilled team, we wouldn't play aggro,because this game favors defensive play,PH plays very aggressive,so much in fact, that the way we beat them is by camping,there's no reason to prove you can beat them in an aggressive battle,when u can just sit there,and win,the reason people can't sit there and win against us,is cus we're better than them,but we could camp out any team in the world and win,since our mechanics are better and you have to waste a cd to engage,you'll lose every engagement,We could make a LoL team. That might be fun.,zab it wont happen man,it just won't,213 is the most mechanically skilled player in EU,he might even be better than me mechanically,but he's worse than ninjas and averse for sure,there's no team like that,so?,we played bigger games before,i was #1 global in rocket league which pays out like 500k a year in prizes,averse was challenger in LoL, i was diamond 1, ninjas was diamond 3,0,cus i quit before there was money,u think i'd be here if i was in that game still?,LOL,i'd be bankin,xaynox, correct.,I do what I enjoy doing.,I'm the best player at ALL games,any genre,any controller,anything,i enjoy it because i enjoy the way the gameplay feels,u have it wrong,im the best at everything,if u name another game,i'll rape you at it,i've always said that,BR is like the game i'm 17th best at,i play BR for money, not because of the competition.,who cares if people agree with you?,i'm always right. Always.,o/,have a good one xanax,o btw,teldo's still a fag,even if croak isn't op,which he isnt,i gotta go to a huge SSBM tournament tomorrow,i'll prolly stream some netplay,that's just it, in my 10 years or so of competitive gaming, i've met 3 other people with as much talent for gaming as me. 2 of them are on my battlerite team. That's why we're unstoppable,we're giant sharks,that happen to be in a small pond,but we'd eat anyone,lol,but he lacks the skill,like i've always said, mentality means nothing,my mentality is this way cause i always win, I dont win because of the mentality,people who force a mentality like mine wont find better results,they'll only find frustration when they end up being wrong,zap,WutFace,https://www.twitch.tv/videos/135497652?t=27m04s,holy mother of god,swag,in flames drummer,🔥,so sick,this nigga on FB,just said his least favorite pokemon type is fighting,fighting,are you FUCKING KIDDING ME,im pissed,SAME?,,everyone is,ya,u fucking close combat people,banded,in their mouthpiece,,,how can they all be so swag,how is this anyone's least favorite type,when fuckin fairy and flying and BUG exist,WutFace,literally the sickest pokemon in ANY gen is a fighting type,,look at this motherfucking breloom,look how SICK it is,,literally half of the fighting type pokemon at dirty as hell,i deleted this person from FB,they are the worst,bug fighters are still sick,H E R A C R O S S,M E G A H O R N B O I Z,U guys smell,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdWkZOo-p0M,maybe one of the best tracks i've ever heard,u know what makes me mad though,when people are overly grandiose and up their own asses about good music in youtube comments,IE; that video,every comment makes me cringe so hard that i wonder if im autistic for enjoying the music,I should probably speedrun hollow knight and become the world record holder,it's actually a marvel of gaming,like, original dark souls level amazing,in terms of inspirations for the game? definitely,in terms of overall quality i think it blows all of them out,i think it's one of those like, braid type games, or fez or something,so legendary like,nothing else will ever achieve the same level of impact within the genre,and it'll be years before another game of that quality in ANY genre comes out,it's legendary imo,ya,one of the best games ever made,Keep in mind btw,i haven't played it either :^),but i have seen the entire game,and im buying it tonight,probably gonna stream the whole thing,like,...Right now,literally right now,15-20 hours for basic completion, worst ending,100% is around 40,from my understanding,it's worth 15 bucks content wise, that's for sure,even if the game wasn't legendary,dont get me started on this stanley parable bullshit,4 hours of non-game game,for 15 bucks,compared to hollow knight,lol,i speedran it 😛,it was good enough for me to speedrun,IE: run through the game dozens of times,given, i dropped the speedrunning of that game rather quickly, in a few weeks,the game didn't have quite the replay value i thought it had after i initially finished it,but i still put in over 100 hours,yeah,it's definitely good,either way, im gonna buy hollow knight and stream rn,if you wanna watch my like true first impressions of it,idk if ur trying to like,avoid spoiler,well,i won't get the true ending my first time through,because i don't wanna spoil it for myself either,im gonna be a true OG gamer like i was as a kid,and try to 100% it without looking anything up,but there's dozens of secrets and fully optional areas/bosses/shit,so im sure it won't go down that way,point is, not everything will be spoiled,or even close,ya the speedrun any% record for hollow knight is 40 minutes,so for a 40 hour game,u gotta understand,it's much more of a metroidvania /dark souls type game,lots of optional shit,lots of exploiring,not very linear,long corridors,the game,i saw a great post that was basically 3 graphs showing dark souls world designs,Dark souls 1 was a circle with small branching paths, some of which led into eachother and some of which led into nothing.,Dark souls 2 was a straight line with very few branching paths, all of which led to nothing.,Dark souls 3 was 2 or 3 different straight lines with a couple of branching off points that led to eachother/nothing, all ultimately ending in one line at the end,imo dark souls 1 design was by far the best,it was like, ingenius,Yeah tbh, people say dark souls is legendary because of it's difficulty, but it's actually way more about mechanics, world design, and a very dark dreary middle-age asthetic almost no other game before it pulled off well,the game isn't even that hard,but it's definitely 10/10 quality,well,for my money, hollow knight is better,you may disagree, but just know you can go into it with high expectations,I have friends who are impatient and dont like exploring and don't care about lore and shit that started off being like "yeah it's pretty good but not as legendary as my friend said",by the end they're all like "this game is a work of art",lol,right,you have to become immersed in the game,to get the full experience,man, we're autistic,anyway ima start stream,,u dare challenge,the plant on head master?,nah,i was like,17 in that pic,i look much more iranian now,:zab:,ik,but he looks like he is,LUL,me,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2arw0RBT1oY,u tryna throw down right now?,uh, yes?,that video is actually comedy gold,im dying,yo,yo it's chill u guys are back and shit but... fuck this ratio,4 dudes 3 chicks. that's gay as FUCK,sorry wade,<:LUL:269941798107873286>,u gotta be fucking my ass,it's been 9 months since i was on the PR,ur boy is washed up,had the death pool too,had to play duck r2 winners,#15 in the world,lol,losers i got whopped by #9 in georgia, some random puff player,then he got whopped by harriet,who then got whopped by eikelman,it was a DEATH pool,u wouldn't know unless u played SSBM,it's the hardest and probably most competitive game of all time,there's at least 400 players, most of which are completely random and you've never heard of, who are actually just fucking insane at the game,i was bordering around top 100 at my peak, but that was with 2~ years of playing and being the best marth in my entire region, plus like injuring my left hand and shit,and y'know, im me,that game is nuts,so much fun,that's why im going back to it now actually,back on the ssbm grind,goat game,well, i was only going back to fuck around and see people i havent seen in forever + play one of my favorite games i quit a year ago + celebrate my 21st birthday and get blackout and puke everywhere (which i did 3 times in 3 days. Swag.),It was definitely worth it,but now i miss melee and the homies,i gotta go back to it,it CALLS to me,battlerite is my money,that will fund my SSBM tournaments,fucking REAL talk,rofl,at least until im back to winning again,probably like 3-6 months off,the game is no joke difficulty wise,and people got way better since I quit, it's another great incentive to come back,no competition back when i played,now people from my region are crazy,like, nationally strong,that's international competition my dude,and melee is a LAN ONLY game,that's what u need to realize,you can't play melee except on a CRT. there's no online tournaments or competition. Most top players don't even consider netplay serious, valid, or worth playing at all for any reason.,when u consider that the closest person who could beat me lived a 2 1/2 hour drive away one way (given, there were about 10 players better than me there, but it's also the 2nd strongest GLOBAL region period.),the competition really wasn't there,lol,Like, players better than me existed,but access to them and practice/tournies against them are few and far between,that's why it's so crazy how some ssbm players are so fucking good,especially the lab monsters who just practice in their room nonstop,that's why there's so many randoms you've never heard of at every big tournament that are insane,there's few tournaments to actually prove your worth, few times to upset truly amazing players,for example, if you're actually amazing at the game you could be top 70 or 80 in the world easily and still get 3 stocked by mew2king on stream the one national tournament of the year you play against him. Maybe you have bad bracket luck too and you face like him in winners and lucky in losers and go out early. Even if you are a great player who would make a ton of impressive upsets, you aren't known and you never will be because you can't fuck with the very best players and RNG wasn't on your side.,SSBM is a super brutal game lol,not even, it's more just like "mew2king is destroying this guy just like he destroys literally everybody",and whether that guy is rank 50 or 500, you'll never know,because m2k destroys him SO hard,Armada.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFl5GPvcVnM,observe the king,T H E K I N G,the king literally doesn't give a fuck about anything,he's the sickest motherfucker to ever live,and he's MAD autistic,ya? he LIVES for ssbm literally,mew2king has lived in over 30 different states in the US, and temporarily in EU and Japan,He is LITERALLY wherever big tournaments are,living with other SSBM players in their house as roommates,goes to every single big tournament,makes fat money every time,the amount of times i've seen m2k literally LYING ON THE FLOOR or on a row of chairs sleeping in the middle of a venue,is too many to count,and i've only met the guy maybe 20 times,<:LUL:269941798107873286>,he's a fucking gangster,everybody wishes they were m2k,nobody has EVER been as cool as m2k,since time began,the only person cooler than m2k,is literally mang0,who ALSO is a ssbm pro,idk how ssbm can be so fucking swag,but it is,every player is the most swag person ever,eoekas,that's just it,it isn't uncounterable,all attacks in smash can be DI'd and smash di'd,at best it's a 50/50, most of the time it's a hard read multiple times in a row,he knows what his opponents will do 3-4 hits in advance,and hard reads it,that's how he gets these ridiculous neverending combos,it's even more impressive when he does it against other top 5 players, considering against top 100 players at all (even me included) you're lucky to ever get more than 3 or 4 hits because the DI and smash DI are so good,he's just a true monster,lol,nobody ever bitches about anything in melee being OP except fox,and fox is so unbelievably difficult to play well consistently that he's allowed to be OP, and still nobody complains about it.,On top of that, his weight/fall rate are the easiest to combo/kill respectively in the entire game,so he's a glass cannon,when played perfectly he's unbeatable, but he gets punished the hardest for mistakes EXCEPT when jank that is "fox being broken" saves him. Like his upsmash hitting behind him when he misses, or shine coming out frame 1 and beating a move that was started earlier,u wouldn't know any of this cus u dont play real games tho <@179306091056726016>,mew2king lives wherever he wants,with whoever he wants,without even asking,he's that sick,doesn't give a fuck about anyone or anything,he's god,G O D,It is, because DI exists,none of them are guaranteed unless he reads or reacts, which is extremely tough because of the game's technical difficulty,you'd understand yourself, once you've played melee for 2 years and still can't do the combos in the video,you'd get it,especially since you can't even do them against players 20 times worse. or AI's which always DI the same way,the game is hard,lol,you'd go "i did the same upair or forward air as m2k did in the video, but they got sent too far away and i can't hit them, wtf?",because they DI'd your hit better,if the question is then "why didnt the guys in the video DI better then" it's because they thought he'd do one thing and he did another,via either conditioning or mindgames/reads,...,I've played the game competitively for years,and im one of the best players of that character in my state,u actually won't understand until u play melee,no other game is like it. The skill ceiling is infinite and nobody will ever achieve it,ever,even if you were to somehow achieve the point of perfect tech skill on fox, smash DI and human reactions would limit how well you could play the game, and you'd still misspace and get hit occasionally,no,the skill ceiling is unobtainable,nobody can even get close to the top,lol,nobody,but fps' are a different genre because unlike fighting games they lack 1v1 and they lack defensive options,it's a game of pure reaction speed and muscle memory and practice,melee is a game of mindgames and reads but also reaction speed and muscle memory and practice,it lacks an element an fps will never have,guilty gear was solved by that one eddie player who won everything,can't remember his name,because eddie was basically fox from ssbm, extremely broken but extremely hard,the difference was, he was broken enough and still easy enough to be played near perfectly, that someone actually managed to do it,be virtually unbeatable with him,fox is simply the most fun character to play, and the fastest,and that's what melee's all about,he is also the best, but he isn't as good as people think,or i should say, other characters are better than people think,at destroying fox,it's just hard because he has the best neutral game,and some of the hardest punishes/gimps/best recovery as well,he doesn't have a huge weakness except that if you're m2k or another player with a truly exceptional punish game, you'll absolutely destroy fox every time you touch him,which is actually a huge weakness,it's just hard to achieve that level of play to be able to do it,kirby literally stands near the ledge,and holds B,and sucks your dreams away,by throwing you off the ledge,or he grabs and upthrows,and slams u both into the abyss,kirby SWAG,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lwh1IsjG05U,if u think marth's got auto combods,combos,watch that vid and you'll see what i mean,look at the people getting hit,and how sometimes they go far af and sometimes they dont,never heard of archeblade,there's a reason for that,because the game is bad and had low skillcap,u aren't a god at anything,u can't be a god unless ur the best at a game a god makes mistakes in,no game except ssbm exists,u must become the closest to perfect a human can become,ie: m2k/mang0,you could play for 10 years,and u wouldn't even be close,that's the beauty of melee,it's a game made for gods,not humans,i've said it sooo many times over the time i've played ssbm,it's a game that's too hard for humans,it wasn't meant to be played by us,if it's so hard i can't be the best in,it's hard,why play piano,when u can play drums,piano is harder, drums is swaggier,swag > skill,melee happens to have infinite of both,he read it,he read that roll,he read that roll,2k15,https://www.twitch.tv/iamarakune,get fucked,$wag,randler,whats ur tag,kk,ya,GOT EMMMMMM,<@99157649139986432> watched an extremely long analysis that picked that vid apart and proved it was fake,suck on MY dick,cus it was just some retard,using fact,and his very own autism,to prove the video fake,i love it,>too old for sports,>sports are the universal thing all men over 30 enjoy,>wutface,i've never cared about ANY sport in my entire life,but when im 35?,im gonna be going to games with my fuckin beer hat,and letters painted on my chest,let's fuckin GO,bad guys winning <:PogChamp:282891715810033665>,beer hat <:PogChamp:282891715810033665>,drunk driving and fan fights <:PogChamp:282891715810033665>,to be honest,football is THE most common thing for any male being to do,I don't know a single person who played it for LESS than like 6 years,I played for like 8,lol,that's such a cynical outlook. It isn't generally watched by retards, they're just THE most watched things period by the general population within a certain age/demographic range, which you're basically indirectly calling retarded,ya, so,everyone played club too,myself included,nah, my dad coached our team,he coached the best team in the state a few years prior,had my brother on it,so he was a pretty well respected coach,he was a legit af coach tho,like, actually,He coached all the teams for my 5 brothers and 1 sister, all of which were statewide/nationally good,he had coached for like 15 years by the time he coached my team,lol,maylon u smell like gothia cup,yw,god i drink beer literally every day since i turned 21,i keep thinking the like magic of it will wear off,but tbh, i just like cold fizzy drinks,and it tastes good af,it's like the same as a cold water,but with flavor,so how good was ur team actually nyy,like comparatively to the rest of germany,rip,ya i quit cause of an injury too,when i was like 15,i definitely would've quit regardless,like i said im the youngest of 6 siblings (with 3-4 years between each) so my dad really pressured me to play soccer all the time because i was the most talented at a young age out of all of them, and some of them had gone to state championships and won and stuff,but i was super lazy and an asshole even back when i was a little kid, so i'd always skip practice and not try and all this other shit,only stuck with it as long as i felt like i had to,quit in early highschool, around the same time i quit highschool altogether,that was when i decided i controlled my life and was gonna do whatever i wanted whenever i wanted to do it,and nobody could tell me not to,lol,i became a TRUE shithead,around the time i quit soccer,went full on "im better than all other beings" mode,and stayed that way for like 3 years,thanks yoltz,u look 8%,<:joll:270381816903368707>,<:wutface:285104381819355136>,kickers doesnt have hekireki on ost tho,so fuck off,what about kevin NANNEY,P P M D <:reddKreygasm:284219897695961089>,kevin NANI?,,he's so based,"That's right, there's nothing to be afraid of.

Here at Stunlock, we're thinking tribal fantasy with a splash of bold action to our new UI artstyling. I feel the black and gold styling you've got going speaks more a car touchscreen device or something more technical and moder",so i respond with,Technical and modern for the purposes of interfacing simply looks better. League of legends' lore is essentially "throw a bunch of strong motherfuckers into the arena and have them kill eachother" (sounds familiar eh?" But the UI of that game looks like something out of star trek. It's clean, concise, and appealing to look at. Perhaps instead of focusing on an invisible appeal nobody actually cares about (How well the UI's theming fits with the game is literally something I've never even heard brought up as a topic of discussion by anybody.) you should simply focus on making it objectively better without using stylistic preferences as an excuse for laziness.,basically,roasted,toasted,dead,i put katie's she-dick in the dirt,rip katie,o there will be sex at lan,when i R word EU,R,word,,i mean,I have an attractive face and a not that attractive physique,it really depends on what the chick is into,i've been called super hot and super unattractive an equal number of times,no i REALLY do,i have the face of a sex god,<:araku:273634035215892491>,frosted tips when,got my 1ms response time 144 hz monitor,Kreygasm,Kreygasm,Kreygasm,Makes me wanna buy a new sound system too,be a TRUE gamer,brand new keyboard, chair, mouse, monitor, speakers, subs, etc,blow people out with my gaming setup,i mean my 4 year old PC still crushes every rig made this year,3600 dollar PC,god im sick,D U A L Q U A D C O R E I 7 6 9 3 0 K P R O C E S S O R,Kreygasm,ssbm is such a filthy looking game,literally looks better than any other game ever released,no idea how it looks so good,SUPER SMASH BROTHERS MELEE FOR THE NINTENDO GAMECUBE™,,ya,i wouldn't expect anyone here to play it,it's too hard for humans to play,only gods,im at 300 apm just doing basic movement on the 4th fastest character in the game,it's a pretty sick `,1,lol @ gc controller can't take 300 apm,ya it can,still gc is pretty suboptimal control method,no controller capable of playing melee properly exists,cus the game is so nuts,lol,melee?,you would never beat me 1 match even if u practiced for years,im really really good,lol,not in melee,in melee even decent players dont make enough mistakes for luck to be real,i have friends i've played ssbm with for 2+ years,who have never taken 1 game off me,not 1,there's no luck,lol,we're talking 8-16 hour sessions too of just playing over and over and over again without breaks,0 losses,2-3 minute matches,blc was bad because of the graphics,not because of low skill ceiling,nah, because i do that to a lot of players,like i said im pretty good,im not a pro or anything tho, i know people who do the same thing to me,and then those people get it done to them by true pros,but im definitely in like a high tier of play,not low-mid,because it takes years of practicing just to become decent,it's the hardest game ever made,it isn't,in fact,i'd bet all of my life savings on it,cus i was one of the most talented melee players anyone had ever seen, especially during my first year or so of playing,and in my first 2-3 months i was still godawful,i mean, amazing for 2 months. Around the area most people 12-16 months in were at,but against the best players in the scene i was still getting 3 stocked every game easily,and here i am 2 years later and WAY better than i was then,and i still lose to those same players almost every time,cus they've also improved,lol,there's nobody who's played 2 months who could get a game off me,even if you practiced 12 hours a day 7 days a week for 6 months straight (there's a guy in our scene named kingmomo who did exactly that),it still took him like 6 months to become good,and he IS really good,but he also put in 1000 hours in 6 months,1000 hours in melee is different than in any other game,because there's 0 SECONDS of afking,on top of that,playing the game for 2-3 hours a day will DESTROY your hands,like so much pain u can't even use them for anything,and on top of that,all of the practice is alone by yourself in your room vs AI,so dedicating that much time is impossible,no there is a ladder,but it isn't worth anything,because nobody who plays online is good,the only tournaments are LAN,to practice tech,ya exactly,it's extremely boring and it injures you,and king momo was already talented,and he no lifed 12 hours a day every day for half a year,to become good,what's swag about the game is a few things,1. it's the hardest game ever made,2. it's the most competitive game ever made,3. it's 1v1 with no luck element whatsoever,4. it's a fighting game,5. it destroys ur hands to even play it and ur tech skill can be disgustingly inhuman,nothing could be cooler,than ssbm,coming from the paladins player,suck my cock,there's games for melee globally 24/7,?,i would know,i play it 24/7,and dont do anything else,the only way to play ssbm,is to be an idiot SAVANT GOD,i was streaming tech skill practice earlier with my inputs on screen,u should see how fast the game is,that's what's swag,the fact that most people will never accomplish it,no matter how much they practice,like i said, the game is made for gods,humans can't play it,only arakune can play it,it's a game made only for me,and swag GODS,game's fucking SICK,?,i was playing against the #15 player on earth,#1 player of his char,on top of that, my char has beaten his in tournament ONE time this year,4 1/2 months,one loss,seems good,fuck no,do u see my char,he has a fucking sword,i promise u,nobody you've ever met can beat me at ssbm,i'd bet any amount of money,i used to do 200+ dollar moneymatches,when i had only played for 6 months and was still a noob,and i won all of them,ya,i dont pay in games that don't take skill,i played melee vs ezmo,who cares,my ezmo would crush any player on earth if they played melee,crush them so badly,they'd never be able to play the game again,regardless nikita ur memes are bad,u probably won't ever understand what's swag about melee,because you don't understand what's fun about competitive games,REAL competitive games,games that are so hard they aren't meant to be played by humans,<@121630407782432769> i'd care more about ur opinion if i had ever seen your name before,who're you again,?,of course it does,but nikita's the one who brought it up,im talking about myself because he's specifically questioning my skill,try to convince people? my presence is proof enough,everything i do is godly,everything i say is godly,i am LITERALLY god,what don't you get,i am LITERALLY god,i am LITERALLY god,i am LITERALLY god,i am LITERALLY god,got it yet,<@227161493227962370> nikita what's a game u think has swag,cus the 2 swaggest games on earth are melee and osu, and it's for the same reason,both games are too hard for normal human beings to even follow with their eyes, let alone hands,both games injure you if you become good at them,both games are 100% raw skill and there's 0 chance of losing to someone worse than u,it's a game where if i say im god,until you prove me wrong,i AM god,there's no excuse u can make,of course,i've said a million times the only reason i claim to be such a god is because nobody proves me wrong,of course, people don't just decide not to prove me wrong,they can't,because im right,sure,but i've never been wrong about my skill at gaming,im a true prodigy,i said it to someone a couple months ago,but i genuinely think i might be the most talented gamer to ever be born,ever in any generation,#1,there's no game im not an absolute monster at,and i've been that way as long as i can remember,what do u mean,i've done a ton with it,,100,000 concurrent daily players,#1,?,why would i do that,u have to understand that my ridiculous gaming skill is backed by how much i enjoy it,i literally can live purely on satisfaction,why would I do something I don't want to do just because im good at it?,that's something people without talent would consider,if i tried to do everything i was immensely talented at, I'd never have time to do things i actually enjoy,im too good at everything,randler,300,😄,i was rank 1 at 200,why do u ask,ya, ik,you aren't arakune,im G R A N D C H A M P I O N season 1 and 2,hold that,o, well keyboard is actually arguably better,it means,no,SUCC,S U C C,,S U C C,feels no succ man,nikita u wanna know what's swag about melee?,,that right there,,,,VERY swag,,the MID popoff,nothing is better than melee,that's actually what i realized at ceo dreamland last week,melee is so good, im getting my license, a car, and a job JUST to travel and play melee,there's no other point in life,it is the ultimate,some degen grocery store or something,im gonna show up to work shot the fuck out every day anyway,with my BROKEN hands,from playing melee,well, everything i've tried to become the best at i've become the best at,ssbm is my favorite game of all time, and on top of that it's the game with the highest competition,I've decided im gonna try my hardest at melee,and see how far i can go,i have a lot of pro player friends who all said i'll be top 100 in 6 months,they know the prodigal son is here,game's been out F I F T E E N Y E A R S,and is the hardest game ever made,nobody gets top 100 in less than 5 or 6 years,6 months is absurd,a decent amount actually,<@98465602670186496> melee has literally dozens of tournaments PER WEEK all over the country and one of the most rigerous top 100 lists ever compiled for any game or sport using only math,It was literally like 265,000 compiled tournament results,and then a scoring system similar to a batting average,to determine top 100 placements,<@98465602670186496> cus u go to the big ones,and destroy good players,it isn't about what place you get,it's about who you beat,bad bracket luck happens to everyone,but if u make an upset on a top 100 player,you're on the map instantly,cus nobody does that,again, melee isn't a game of luck,you beat a player worse than you 100% of the time,<@98465602670186496> well that's true, but I think he was referring to my skill moreso than my actual ranking.,Besides, miom rankings are yearly regardless.,..,u have that backwards,but a lot of players within the 6-15 range are of very similar skill,if ur rank 30,u NEVER beat rank 5,N E V E R,when i say never,i mean they've played at every major tournament for like 8 years,and they've won like 0-2 sets,lol,melee is insane,u literally have to ascend beyond being human just to become decent at melee,and then there's the actual reincarnation of christ,at the top,eoekas,just play on emulator,ya,some decent players play on netplay,more recently a lot of top players have been,i played against the #2 falco on earth on netplay like last week without realizing it,got some games off him,he was crazy though,ya,the entire time before i knew who he was,i was like,"this guy sucks dude im playing so bad",learned who he was,suddenly it all made sense,tbh the biggest reason i didn't give him credit instantly was because our games were so close,every game was last stock and like i said i won a few,he gave me the "great games bro" afterwards,smug bastard,i'm gonna smash him,zzzz,D A S H I Z W I Z,from florida,actually maylon, me and this guy from my region tampa had this beef for about 2 years,over who the "best marth in tampa" was,we've been the same skill the whole time even though we've both gone from nonames to the top of our scene, we've literally ALWAYS gone 2-1 last hit last stock every set. There was never a time when the sets weren't like an asshair away from going the other way,we're like dead even in set counts,on top of that, he plays a super defensive campy white marth and i play a super aggressive in your face black marth. AND i'm an asshole and he's a super nice guy,it's some anime shit, we couldn't be any more opposite,well my rival played shizwiz in tournament like, 3 months ago,and crushed him 3-0,i've been gone 9 months,and in that time he's not only passed me,but he's #1 in our region,so i have to take my title of best marth in tampa back,and simultaniously fuck his bitch,in front of him,wut,i haven't played him tho,i'd love to play him,I told him to moneymatch me at ceo dreamland,and he went,"nah no thanks",that FUCK,i think deep down,he was scared,even tho he's way better,man i've played ssbm for like 7 hours today,i'd take a break, except i have a tournament 1 1/2 hours away in like an hour,gotta go win that,then come home and grind out more netplay,I leave in an hour,it's at 5:30,1 1/2,not 11,lol,MFW,ONE,AND A HALF,ROFLLLLLL,EU <:LUL:269941798107873286>,nah,im getting it soon tm,dude im eating ramen noodles to fuel for this tournament,ramen = godmode,sick,alright guys,what's the best flavor for ramen noodles,well im glad you asked,it's chicken,no other answer will uffice,suffice,sorry rifle,im better than u,ur inferior taste buds have no place here,👎🏻,ur welcome,rifle is literally,trapped within the gates of hell,also known as a committed relationship,im NOT about that shit,LATA BITCH,as far as im concerned,with the insane gaming talent i have,if i can still use my hands when im 25, i've failed,must DESTROY hands,playing game,POGCHAMP,TURTLERIDER82,Never forget rifle,when i got on for honor after a week of not playing,and destroyed turtlerider82,then got off and uninstalled the game,literally never played again,MISSION,COMPLETE,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qubZPQkw2Hg,rare footage,of arakune,ya,i like hella underperformed tho. I went there to celebrate my 21st bday and see all my friends i havent seen since i quit more than to compete. I haven't played at all for 9 months after all,i only started playing again after the tourney,i drowned in pools,rip,it's only been like 9~ days since the tourney and im wayyyyy better now tho,just was super rusty,ya,i have BR esports money to blow on whatever,that's why i got my 1ms latency 144 hz monitor today,?,Literally every tourney in ssbm costs money to enter,AND has a venue fee,ssbm doesn't fuck around,u lose money unless u get 2nd or better at locals,and like 8th or better at locals,which have 300+ entrants,8th or better at majors*,actually funny u mention that, we have 1 carpool from our region going,but apparently it's the "tampa esports" association or something and they're getting paid,we dont have anyone else from our region going, so no,i actually asked probably an hour ago,so good timing on that,LUL,maybe in 6 months,nikita like trolling aside,do u not realize ssbm is the 2nd biggest fighting game in history behind street fighter,it's RLY huge,i told u, if i spent all my time doing things im good at instead of enjoying myself, i'd have no time for the things i enjoy,im not the kind of guy who wants to study 14 hours a day for 8 years and become a doctor,because i'd kill myself long before i got there,i dont have the patience,ya,that's why i wait for BR to blow up,why else would i play a game of this genre,given, when i started i didn't realize how doomed the game was from the start,but i actually had pretty much the same idea,i needed a game that i could solo carry in and pay for my existence with,unfortunately at the highest level, you can't solo carry in battlerite, but it still takes more skill and more of the game is in your hands than smite, LoL, dota, cs, etc,because i've never been very good at FPS/RTS genres,actually, i was pretty good at rts. i just didn't play them much,i am,but im only as godly as a person can be,i said im the most talented person to ever live when it comes to gaming,which is probably true,or not far off from true,god is a relative term anyway,religion and gods don't exist,but people worship them anyway,as long as people worship me im a god,and they will eventually,cus im so amazing,i'd play if i didnt SUCC at cs,what're u,deaf and stupid,u fuckin european,how the fuck am i gonna get to austin,why would i spend money,i can waste money,but not literally hundreds of dollars,for no reason at all,on a whim,to go to an event that's a pain to travel to anyway,several hundred dollars,prolly like 200 for the room and however much uber halfway across the country would be,which they wouldn't do btw,florida,tampa,flying out of FL is absurdly expensive btw,roughly 100-200 dollars more expensive for a flight the same distance to the same airport,cus fucking florida SWAG,no,lol,u thought i was joking?,florida is insane,lol,they're like "why would you ever leave florida",and as someone who's been to like 15 other states,i fucking agree,rest of the world SUUUUUCKS,florida BOIZ,no,only other countries worth visiting are canada which is exactly the same as the USA,literally exactly the same. except colder.,and EU which is WAY too far,so where would i have been,there's only one greatest baby,eoekas ur dumb dude,even if u guys got 350 for the flight i wouldn't go,nah,need more practice,in 6 months i'll go there myself,and destroy everyone,ya that's true,but it isn't worth the travel annoyance/expenses,u also have to keep in mind how many of the best players in the world live in FL,FL is literally the 2nd strongest region anywhere on earth,and the strongest region in FL is like 90 minutes away from me,so really, Florida and california are the only states where you don't have to travel out of state at all to become a top player,because everyone is a god,they're all over,but

reason,i always fuck up the first like 3-4 words in a row,before i figure it out,my brain just doesnt work,lol,,117,not too bad,warming up finally,messed up the first 2 words again,funny u should mention that,on the same note, i've been thinking,what's the MOST OPTIMAL way to get every last drop of piss out of your dick so it doesn't get all over your boxers?,I use the multiple FLICK method,but i've begun to wonder,how many flicks is it before you're playing with your dick?,this is a REAL question,with multiple different answers,i could be potentially saving seconds,trinityinfinity,and he's worse than ITF by a ton,which says enough,dude,agree to disagree,u were AT LEAST the worst player on ur own team,which had good players,but not like top players,it's not arrogance,there were several matches during the poloma/varesh meta where we only beat ITF's team because of his misplays,Like, close matches we should've lost,if i didn't outplay him SO hard 1v1,over and over every round,i never had to adapt,you didn't improve no matter how many times we played,even over the course of rounds,i could actually list your entire playstyle in a flowchart back to you right now and I haven't even played you in 2 months,i can SEE your jade in my head,and i know exactly what you'll do,you don't have to take it so personally,the truth hurts,nah,wait,what?,he had a team?,that's keywi and uh.,...,who,o ok,they got top 8?,dude, fuck NA,LOL,verosk,ur wasting your time,ITF was it you or trin that 1v1'd averse?,i thought it was trin,ya,averse crushed him,with his level 1 jade,in the ditto,nah,he lost,5-2 or 5-3,they might've rematched,or it might've been bo3,o,well either way,averse's jade is like,worse than hitler,so,it says enough, again,bad*,ya,ur mechanics are good too,u just dont think,if only u mained shifu,that's my LIFE,brainlessly smash opponents,with mechanical skill,backhanded compliment counts,ur welcome,i mean it's prolly not clear from the fact that i bm u constantly,you're one of my favorite people/players,it's actually why im so harsh about ur play,cus u disappoint me,and im a fan,im just the USA Pride master,and it hurt me,that i could never say NA had the best jade,literally never at any point,and like, i could say we did with chars like shifu, where it's debatable and there's no way to prove who's better cause ping,even though you guys couldn't 1v1 the skill difference was obvious,tilted me so hard,verosk sux,jade's just SUPER broken,always has been always will be,literally forever,cus she has 2 instant escapes, stealth, and 2 instant ccs,anyone with a brain will make that work in any meta,it's way too strong,actually 3 instant ccs,and 2 of her 3 ccs double as escapes as well by creating distance,oh myyyyyyy god,jade balanced,nikita <:PogChamp:282891715810033665>,womack ur bad,haha LOL,GOT EEEEEEEEM,wow itf congrats,you're me when i was,LITERALLY,9 years old,9,i think i hit 100 wpm when i was

d,ya,it's like,very small dog,the kind u carry around in a purse,barks at EVERYTHING,forever,pees on EVERYTHING,it's the worst,dog,i want an american pittbull,my buddy has one,210 pounds,weighs almost twice as much as me,dog is a fuckin god,https://youtu.be/gYstlVJ-YAM?t=26m53s,me to womack,that timestamp,is the most fire moment,get the FUCK out BILLY,u pick it up,and then u place it,elsewhere,G E T T H E F U C K O U T B I L L Y,W H O T H E F U C K A R E Y O U,G O T H E F U C K H O M E,Let em know ONE TIME,ULU,fargo is a really shitty movie,that my mom LOVES,and i watched it with her and i was like,"i really dont like it",which is weird, cus normally her taste in movies/shows lines up with mine,but fargo is fucking WACK,it's the worst,i've spoken to like 10 other people about it too,and they ALL disliked it,i think my mom might just be stupid,but she has like 146 IQ so ???,Wutface?,Yeah, it is.,But it's 2 different things,like i dont believe the show has anything to do with the movie,and i've heard NOTHING but like resounding praise for the show,everyone thinks it's amazing,ya apparently the show is amazing,like straight amazing,but i haven't seen it,well if u think about it snoobl,i'm actually my own dog,woof,:DogChamp:,u guys see the video from the netherlands prime minister or whoever the hell he is,calling islam evil,that was a wild ride,ya,idk who he is,but he seemed pretty important,ya that guy,maybe,question marks,i think that was it anyway,n1 series is easily sopranos,there's not even a close second place,the show is legendary,straight legendary,if someone told me,"recommend a show to me and if i dont like it im gonna murder you",and i had to think of one show,it would be sopranos,would BET my life on it,100%,ya,i mean, sure maylon,but everyone i've spoken to who's seen sopranos says it's their favorite show.,Have you actually seen it?,just asking,it's definitely within the top tier no matter what your tastes are,dude, it's better every time you watch it,so much crazy shit you catch the 2nd and 3rd time through,well, nothing close to it i've seen,I havent seen breaking bad,or dexter,or a lot of shows that are supposedly good,game of thrones,A lot of people tell me dexter is shit now, but when it was airing it was in EVERYONE's top 2 or 3 shows ever.,I heard it got way worse in the last couple seasons,but my buddy jeff said he LOVES dexter,one of his favorite shows ever,so im not sure,woof,u smell like boston legal,u smell,dialogue in sopranos might be the best ever,it's so unreal good,im VERY nice guy,idk what ur talking about,no,otaku and weeaboo arent terms for "guy who watches/enjoys anime",specifically, it's someone who's so obsessed with anime, hentai, and anything related to asian culture that they forsake their own culture in an attempt to BECOME that culture,it's the white people who like, wear kimonos and only watch hentai and are obsessed with anime (watched 500+ shows),and have a katana on their wall,and speak bad japanese that they only learned from watching anime,THAT'S a weeaboo,absolute cancer,asian people actually despise them far more than anyone else,because they make a mockery of their culture,lol,nikita,i've never played pubg but it looks very fun,if i buy game wanna play?,we can play on RUSKI server,idc,<@227161493227962370>,then EU servers,whatever,sounds fun 😄,i buy game rn,1 sec,im downloading game,u have time for a game or 2 without me nikita,8gb,40~ minute DL for me,NOOOOOOO NIKITA,D:,ya,my internet is pretty fast,but not rn for some reason,rip,i dont,i have 100mb/s up/down,it's just being throttled for some reason,might be someone else in house using it,ya im at 20% done right now,ok,probably awful,but being honest, pubg is definitely gonna be my "chill and act like a retard with friends" game,im too hardcore at every other game, need a chill game,im definitely gonna be a fucking idiot in pubg,and not care if i win or not,lol,like the entire game is gonna consist of me running in circles and blocking doorways,while nikita yells about it,so idc about ping,it is,because it's like 80% downtime 20% intense shootouts,but i suck at shooting in fps anyway,so whether im serious or not doesnt matter,LUL,like, i put 1000 hours into dayz,which was pubg with zombies and WAY shittier,and i had so much fun in that game just trolling and being a retard,mod,standalone never came out lol,they've pushed it back like 4 times,SLS 4Head,dayz was a shitty mod for a game with shitty mod support,and it was TOO slow, TOO realistic,couldn't hit someone 200 feet away unless u knew wind velocity, which there was no way to know,ADS on weapons sucked, intentionally,like 80% of the arma/dayz community were post-war veterans,because it was SO realistic,which was cool, but most of the time it culminated in missing for 200 bullets straight (and the guy you were shooting at never even realizing where he was being shot at from),and like,2-3 hour spans without encountering anybody,lol,i think pubg hits the sweetspot of realism/tension and arcadeyness/fun/playability MUCH better than arma,h1z1 is too arcadey,arma/dayz too realistic,pubg very good,first person only sounds dope,i also really like dynamic weather,I heard they're adding wind velocity to aim as well in pubg eventually,but i worry it'll make it too hard,Im honestly most hyped for mods,if someone makes a dayz mod or something similiar with pubg's engine,i'd pay like 100 dollars for it,play it forever lol,that's not true,l4d was a revolutionary game. a lot of people dislike it now because it's "generic" but that game literally sold people on the xbox 360,myself included,it was super amazing for the time, and one of the best arcadey zombie games,also one of the first good asymmetrical multiplayer games where u got to play as zombies and like have the gameplay be meaningfully different,game is sick,but in terms of like, realistic zombie games? almost all of them suck,dayz was the closest anyone got to a good game but it had problems like i said,too realistic, laggy servers, too slow of pacing,<:PogChamp:282891715810033665>,:MiniChamp:,<@227161493227962370> im at 80%,what kind of table?,if it's a wooden or stone table,that's insane,i heard that one time when i was 1 year old the

change with v,LUL,ok i figure it out,ya but u can't like,run away,and look behind u,at the same time,without holding a key,u know what i mean?,ya ik,it isn't in the controls in this game,change camera is V,so i assume it's just one of the cycles or something,how do u finish game? it says ur offline when i look u up,<:feelsnikitaman:284752940290539531>,OH,MY,FUCKINMGGOD,I BOUGHT IT,ON THE WRONG

was actually even better than i thought it'd be,and it was already a game i planned on investing 1000+ hours in,probably won't stop playing it for at least a year,it's ridiculously good,I'm bad at it,but it's still sick,i enjoy it probably because im bad at it,i know the optimal playstyle in that game, but i don't enjoy playing that way,And it wouldn't matter anyway since my aim is bad,ya, i did,put in a few hundred hours,I wasn't top 500,but I was like,top 1% or something,i mean, it's me you're talking about, so that's the bare minimum in any game,Reaper,I mean I played a lot of chars cause you have to in that game,reaper, genji, tracer, soldier, junkrat, xenyatta, winston, roadhog, lucio was basically it,but i was reaper/genji mostly,idk what this feeling is,but every time i check my bank account expecting to be SO fucked,i actually have more money than i did the last time i checked it,even though i buy stupid shit literally every single day,wtf is my life,swag,somehow gained money since i bought my 350 dollar monitor like 4 days ago,????,im pretty sure,there's never been a good parody ever,of anything,the best parodies ever done by anyone were weird al parodies of popular songs,which are still only good when ur like 12,because parody,dude melee is SO hard,won 2 different sets 2-1 in a row against super fast fox players,im like drenched in sweat,what is this game,how is it so SICK,dude my left hand is still physically warm even though i stopped touching the controller like 3 or 4 minutes ago,my entire hand is HOT to the touch,melee's sick as fuck,w i t h h a t e w e

fun,u wanna play snoobl?,my friend taught me a bunch about the game when we played yesterday,i feel pretty competent now,havent won yet tho,gotten top 3 twice tho,man i can't believe how many times i nailed that guy,i hit like 4 out of 5 shots,and they were quick shots too,and he just didn't go down,headshotted me,zzzz,must've been on a sliver,ok,aren't jackazzm jokes just like,"i feel pretty neutral about this",esl thinks BR is gay,PRL is self funded, ik that,so even if that was true, NA won't lose the PRL tourney,,got the last kill,only reason i had 1 kill was because both of my teammates had supressors and i had compensator so i couldn't give our position away,i was on that SCOUTING life,im serious,they legit were like "dont shoot",i went "ok",except the final 3v3

they're giving us pretty special treatment compared to the rest of the teams,im sure if we didn't demand but like, really rode their ass about something we'd get it,pretty much no matter

fucking PEELS out,like slams the gas,to get away from him,im being stalked LOL,it's either a hitman, a spiteful idiot from the internet, or like a government investigator looking for evidence to convict someone from my house of a crime without a warrant,like the only 3 explanations,and honestly, im ok with all 3,if u wanna kill me let's fucking GO,well eygrr,that's not true,it could be police themselves,who dont want to be seen,in an unmarked car for example,we also live really really close to the highschool, like within 2 minutesz,my sister speculated someone was trying to race,but idk the whole context of like,whether the car was parked outside,or just happened to be passing by,or what the deal was with all the details,apparently my sister sees people race alllll the time,against randoms,but like,straight up,i would've sideswiped that fool,one time,LUL,if a hitman showed up and said some internet meme,i'd be like,"this is exactly how i want to die",and then die,worth,Kreygasm,when they'll end up making a movie about the actual craziness of my death,pog,champ,well, real talk, i hope if it's a stalker or something they're after me and not my family,the type of retard that could go after me,is WAY less dangerous,than the type that goes after my family,lol,my mom hated her job for like weeks,and then 3 days ago said everyone became super nice,🤔,ya,my mom is a nightmare,she's actually the best person on earth,but she's also the worst,at the same time,im more scared of like,people from discoheat or actual nuts retards like l0l or dadisblack or

player on EARTH is worse than ninjas at every champ,including averse,who's STILL better than everyone else,and then nikita's 3rd,and im somewhere in there,like 5th or 6th or something,cus i dont play the game at all,klerny prolly above me,idk womack 5th place after not playing the game at all seriously in 4+ months is like,both hilarious and disgusting,everyone else sucks sooooooo bad,lol,ya, i haven't gotten worse at all,i simply refuse to get better,because it would remove all tension and fun remaining from the game,the last 2 tourneys haven't been much fun,because i played seriously,i don't think at all when we play in tournes,tournies*,don't even TRY to outplay my opponents,just hit counters and time benders and eat incaps and actually,do not give a single fuck,and we still crush them,so if i try it's like,zzzz,onslaught > mortals,i literally hold down M1 and W,and im like "he's gonna counter here",and swing into it anyway,because i care SO little,makes no difference whatsoever,care so little that i can't expend the mental energy to flick away or hit c,because it's literally,any effort,at all,so i just hit it,cus it doesn't matter,the fuck u want kid,i'll say it one time and one time only,if i try, im still the best player on earth,there is not and will not ever be anyone who can face me,it simply isn't worth expending the effort to try,since we will always win,always.,no no, they're the best if im not playing seriously,i can beat them both,i can beat literally anyone,at anything,it's called "being arakune",i would if i tried,actually, i'd crush you,100% of games,rekt,real talk,if we ever lose a tournament,(which we will not),you'll see me try my hardest the following tournament,until i get bored,which is exactly what happened when we lost because i wasn't home on a laggy different setup,literally the next week,we smashed project horizon with their own comp,because i was mad,surprised they didn't uninstall,if anyone played my char against me and won i'd uninstall,and bury myself,immediately,because i don't try,ever,it's different to win in 1v1 or solo queue compared to tournament,in tournament i won't lose ever,it's just a fact,9 straight months now,anyone who equates our "loss" to anything is a pitiful joke of a human being.,well,i enter every single tourney,and commit rape on stream,for the fuckin FANS,😎,i should play some BR,something's been kinda fun about it lately,idk what,but only for like 30~ minute spans,mmm,no,u suk,idk what that means,nah,nah,nah,nah,<:feelsSomethingman:285783203913138187>,69,69,uh?,i didnt blame lag braindead fuckin faggot,i was at my dad's house on a new pc with 30 fps, a new mouse and keyboard, and a weird sideways monitor that was a foot too high,IE: suck my cock you fat fuck,i'd rape you and anyone else in the game on my pc,as i have for 9 months,fucking retard,dumbfuck,2 digit IQ,im joking,i told u already,the first time we lose,REALLY lose,you'll see me try,until im bored,which will probably be 2-3 tournies after that,we'll 10-0 every opponent,with no exceptions,for 3 straight tournaments,lol,there is no convo,there is no loss,i have 0 losses on my pc,the only thing that matters,give me a decent mouse,and over 30 fps,and i'll fuck you in your fat ass,in front of your entire shit continent,your breathing is gay,your breathing is an embarassment to the human race,end it all,hang self from tree,good,if you have to try that hard to breathe,just give up,get better genetics,fucking lardass,im sure u do,fat fucks always have excuses,for the unhealthy disgusting existence,you can lie to yourself,but you can't lie to me,stop smelling like shit,well,that's up to ur discretion honestly,i dont speak french,or swahili,or taiwanese,so idk what u just said,i can literally say and do,anything i want,at all times,always,and am ALWAYS right,that's what it means to be me,Le fuck off,<:feelsSomethingman:285783203913138187>,man,these convos are actually so fun,best way to kill 20 minutes,but now im bored again,zzz,oh yeah,ssbm is actually a GREAT idea,but im busy eating cheetos,and cannot,WutFace,blankz,ur team blows,suck my all american dick,u should retire,im just being a prick,4th best team in EU isn't that bad,but you won't ever win,so,should probably quit,maylon <:PogChamp:282891715810033665>,oh, the site is made by womack?,i havent checked the website,but i'll bet like,ehhh 100 bucks,that the comment about me, if there is one, is really aggressive and salty,because womack actually cries,every time i mention him,or he mentions me,or really any time anything happens at all,womack cries at me,for some reason,and everyone else tells him "everyone flames everyone here, get over it",and he goes,"REEEEEEEEEEEE",at me,wtf,oh fizzi,you know the girl who's in the cummies video,is my ex?,NOT joking,she's pretty cute actually,Ya, that chick,she's like equally as weird as me,way way mentally crazier,i can't give u proof cus then you'd know who she is,and probably harass her,look no offense, i like u guys a lot,but ur like JUST over the line,of people i'd give other people's info to,lol,no rifle she lives like,90 minutes from me,she's actually the one who got me into ssbm originally,before i became a monster at it,i don't watch movies, wtf?,our relationship ended super fast because im a scumbag,who doesn't care about anything,it was swag,mmmm,i mean u have a kid,so that's fair,swag,dadswag,just play maplestory,dude how is maplestory so fun,i just want to grind 19 hours a day,every day,forever,i've put like,70 hours into MS,in the last 5 days,<:feelsSomethingman:285783203913138187>,lol 10k hours,what's it like being a casual gamer,12k hours in LoL,2000 in mw2,6000 in blazblue,3000 in osu,2000 in OSRS,1600 in BR,800 in RL,i should rly game more,26800 hours = 1116.6667 days,Damn, im a fucking monster,4 YEARS of games,in literally like,10 years,what a fucking god,the 10 hours a day AVERAGE,for a decade straight,god,how do i game so much,4 years of gaming in 10 years is actually crazy,especially when u consider how many games i have with like,200-400~ hours,that i just never touch again,there's like dozens,ya,im a monster,there's only 1 arakune,there's nothing greater in this world,I've said so for at least 14 years,and my opinion on the matter will never change,i'd give up literally anything for the ability to game competitively,it's what i live for,that's the definition of laziness,i can succeed at literally any game i feel like succeeding at,i'm just lazy and hate practice,hate trying,im more of a "crush you without trying and taunt nonstop" kind of guy,than a true serious gamer,who competes among the best,i was pro level in LoL,i just played 1 champ,so it was never practical to play tournament,because of bans/draft/comps/camping/etc,I was just a monsterous trynd,beat pretty much every pro player i played against in solo queue,like, badly,including every other top trynd,u only need ONE,hero,u need TRYND,where u bet it all on 35% crit RNG,and get it 100% of the time,because you main trynd,no,when trynd got banned i just dodged,cus the only people who banned him knew i was on the other team,cus im nightmare,yeah, you suffered a penalty,minor rating loss/having to wait,but u did it anyway,because it's better than playing something ur bad at and losing,as long as u win most of the games on ur main, the penalty from leaving is nothing,lol, not true blankz,my challenger friend, jeff who i always talk about,also mained trynd,i was the one who introduced him to the game,and he used to dodge EVERY game that he queued onto the purple side,which he knew using a third party client,Because at the time, blue side had something absurd like a 56% global winrate,yeah,so he just refused to play on purple side,because the jungler would dominate his bot lane and no matter how hard he won top he'd lose,most of the time purple side,i played it out because i thought it was kinda scummy to use a third party client to see whether or not you should click "accept' on the match,but, i felt where he was coming from,playing on purple side suuucked,made it harder to lane with the camera too,of course,anyone with 10,000 hours knows all the TECH,it also showed who you were with/against pre-match,and their winrates,mains,everything,tbh i knew for so long i just kind of assumed people knew,but it was eventually banned,because it counted as cheating,well, they never banned the feature which lets you see which side you're on,so rather than just banning people's mains,you could just dodge the 44% winrate,which was still fine,jeff used to tilt super hard tho,in league, if you fail to accept a match 3 times you get penalized,so he'd get purple side > not accept,purple side > not accept,purple side > accept > dodge,purple side,rage for 20 minutes,and then he'd literally just smash them on purple side anyway,<:LUL:269941798107873286>,man,being the golden child of onslaught is sick,they're doing an interview right now with some player,and i wanna just hop in any be like "YEAYUH",cause they won't do shit,it'll be a good one,arakune,professional shit disturber,xD,xD,ROFL,only joltz has popular memes,holy shit,u guys are fucking noobs,yes, the mostly recently hit cc will overwrite previous ccs regardless of any kind of duration or priority,taya overwrites oldur ult,/thread,well that's only because there's 3 kinds of ccs,or i guess 4,actually the only exception is panic/stun not overwriting petrify,probably because the "petrify" effect is coded to exist as long as the shield it grants is above,0,classifying things into groups and schools has no meaning,all that matters is how the mechanics function,however you describe it, it acts different from every other cc in that way,if you wanna give it it's own "school" i actually dont care,at all,but it isn't an oversight,it's intended,the most recent cc is the only one that effects, with the exception of petrify since petrify will always exist as long as the shield exists,there's no need to classify anything in a more specific way than that,i just covered every single possible scenario in the game,ya i missed one, panicking someone out of a stun won't move them,but that's irrelevant,since a champ with a stun and a champ with a panic will never be on the same team,ever,ur right,because it's an instant loss,lol,croak jade is an instant win,overrides the instant loss,croak ashka oldur on the other hand,is such a strong comp it guarantees NOT ONLY an instant win,but an entire TOURNAMENT win,instantly,as soon as you pick it,with 0 gamelosses,ya i agree,he's actually even stronger now,since his cc is more stunted and spaced out,can rotate skills with a 2~ second window to hit him,with which he out dpses you anyway,cus his burst is insane in a short span,he's just like ezmo actually,u get 2 seconds to punish him,and during those 2 seconds he just kills you if you try to fight him,cus he's way stronger in a straight up brawl anyway,i should rephrase, because that phrasing sounds odd,it's more like his CDS are rotated in such a way that you SHOULD only get 2 seconds to punish him,but as if that wasn't bad enough, in actuality you get 0 seconds,since he can fight you and win whenever he wants.,o./,nah i did,woke up at like,midnight,or something,maybe like 2 am,i dont remember,was literally,hours ago,and i dont bother remembering that long ago,since i contradict myself so many times within that span,2 much work,lol,sooooo happy teldo quit,real talk, i have some empathy,sad to hear he quit tho,or sorry,not to hear he quit,im sorry to hear he's sick,just what i heard from twitch,i have no idea,apparently he's quitting to deal with his sickness,oh so he ISN'T sick?,dope i can insult him then,fuck that faggot,ROFL,S W A G,🇺🇸,if a sickness kept someone from competing, i'd have some empathy,i had to quit soccer cus of that,and i was a fucking monster,of course,i told u, there's nothing im not amazing at,😛,all it comes down to is intelligence + super exceptional hand/eye coordination  + dedication,can become good at anything fairly fast,rly isn't hard,oh u know what i wanna become good at,fishing,fishing is SO fucking sick,i've only gone fishing maybe 3 or 4 times,and it's probably my 2nd favorite thing behind video games,even tho i've only gone a few times,legit LOVE fishing,no, it is,and every croak main has it,zab got it on the physical side,cus he's arab,he rly is,rip :zab:,where the fuck has zab been anyway,he was like 80% of the reason i stuck around this server,zab's a homie,rip zab,fuck dude,i played maplestory,for 23 of the last 28 hours,and all my dailies are done like 7 hours into the day,what the fuck do i do now,honestly,both are great choices,i played pubg for the first time in like a week yesterday,er,like,an hour ago, not yesterday, wtf brain,got 3 kills,got gangbanged by 4 angles at once,killed 2,gaming god,had to run into open field next to quarry cause of circle,domed 2 people from like 1000 meters,8x fully stacked m4 Kreygasm,?,ur joking right,on BR and rocket league i AVERAGED over 16 hours a day,for 3+ months,ROFL,i can stay up for 3+ days easily,and game nonstop,u lack discipline,u would think,but i went to my doctor last month,and everything's perfect,blood pressure/sugar/abnormal shit,he was like "couldn't be healthier",fucking swag,he was like "u smoke pot?",i was like "hella",he just had nothing to say,it was a good one,probably expected me to say no,but i've never cared less about anything,he was like "im gonna stop prescribing adderal if u dont get a job",and i was like "well im not getting a job","and i dont take the adderal anyway",which is true,sooooooooo sick,adderal is literally cheat codes for gaming,when i take adderal,i can stay up for like,40+ hours with ZERO fatigue,feel like i just woke up,40 hours in,as a matter of fact, i can't sleep,even if i've been awake for like 30 hours,im like "why would i sleep, i JUST woke up","it's barely been a full day",spelled ezmo wrong,Title: 黄泉より聴こゆ、皇国の燈と焔の少女。,REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE,nikita,ily,>nikita alone in nikita's kingdom,<:PogChamp:282891715810033665>,iva would be top tier,if ezmo didn't exist,same as shifu, actually,ezmo's EXISTENCE removes half the cast from the game,takes shifu from insanely broken to like,mid tier,ezmo is twice as good as iva at everything,and they have the exact same kit,soooooo,ezmo oldur shifu probably the strongest comp in the game,in this game, the only way to deal with the truly insane champs is to mirror them, since u can't waste 2 counterpicks on their char or you'll have a weakness,in the case of like ezmo, there aren't even 2 counters to him in the game at all,in fact, there's 0,he's probably the only champ in the game's history to have 0 losing matchups,croak sucks yeah,dogshit,that's why teldo quit,he's not good like me, when my champ was deleted i played the broken champ (teldo's champ, ironically) and continued to win with it,what does teldo do? he quits,because he lacks the skill to adapt to change,where's teldo's top level shifu?,it doesn't exist,ya,but i know a guy who's top 50 in the world in pubg,and he's a youtuber/streamer/entertainer,and not even a serious gamer,at all,so,lol,ya that's all u do,u parachute as early as possible, drift SUPER far towards a town with a car spawn, run 10 minutes across a field to get there (since nobody can possibly be in front of you),and then if circle's on you, you sit there in the building. Endlessly.,If it isn't, you grab a car and bumrush a building in the circle with ur s12k,and shit on everyone,lol,like, u basically go for 0 human contact, always camp in building with shotgun if possible, NEVER use a real gun or engage in an actual gunfight unless you have like a silenced m24 or something super insane,nyy ur SO crazy,iva sucks,lucie sucks BAD,like really really bad,probably worse than raigon,lol,the op champs right now are ezmo, shifu, poloma, sirius, and oldur,imo,notice 3 of those are supports,only 1 viable melee and ranged lol,oh nvm forgot jade,jade is SO insane,we just never see her in NA,but she's like probably 2nd behind ezmo,sooooooooo overpowered,she might even be first, but idk,like i said nobody plays here,no, we have trickmasta,plays 16 hours a day every day,on pestilus,and he beats all the top players in solo queue with him,it's just solo queue,pest will always suck in 3v3,if he ever spaces he dies from full hp,i told u, i dont even remember conversations i had 8 hours ago cus my opinions constantly shift and i contradict myself constantly,but that's why im one of the best players,u guys are on conversations from 2 weeks ago,WAY outdated,of course eoekas,situations change in matters of minutes,just because im always the first one to say something everyone eventually ends up agreeing with,doesn't mean im wrong,it means im BETTER,well, iva rapes croak now,because everything rapes croak,thank god,croak sucks,u guys are 2 weeks late as always,in 2 weeks, you'll agree croak's trash,unless u just circlejerk nonstop despite him not making top 2 in any tournament in EU or NA,in which case that's on you,ya, people haven't learned to play against him yet,as always, you're slow,we crush croak,he's trash,jeter is better than any player in EU,by far,and im 100,000 times better than him,and my teammates at 10,000 times better than me,jeter's the guy who's been crushing wuzac for the last 3 weeks,like, extremely onesidedly,in fact, it's the only reason blankkz team has lost,is wuzac losing the 1v1 vs jeter SO badly,ya,except i taught ninjas,lol,i taught ninjas and ninjas never took a break,i quit for 5 months, averse quit for 1 or 2,ninjas quit for,0 days,0,that's why he's so good,he's where i'd be if i hadn't quit,but probably slightly worse,actually, nah,i'd be a lot better,but he is super good,yeah yeah,put the money in the bag,jeter,is croak player from NA,who's been grinding every day for like 9 months,started off bad,but last month or two he's looked really good,he's teaming with stro now,and they aren't bad,no, they're better than everyone in EU,i told you already,if there was a lan with every team,joltz would get 3rd,they'd get 2nd,we'd get 1st,with a 10-0,as always,ya chalt,didn't figure u were worth mentioning since they dont know who u are,not even talking shit,it's just a NA/EU culture thing,jeter vs klerny on NA?,depends on the champs, 1v1's are pretty jank,wrong,i wasn't home,people don't even beat me on my ping,eoekas shut up you pseudo-intellectual average chess player pos,child molesting pearl main,cocksucker,well at the time, wuzac was on EU's best team,considering they had won like 4 EU tournies in a row when they beat us,by 1 round, when i wasn't home,in other words,if i have my mouse and a monitor with above 30 fps,i'll destroy anyone anywhere,consider it a freebie,i could've just dropped out,joltz, telroskmi, and a couple others iirc,they were dominating the EU scene,klerny,u underestimate how bad you are,we'd crush you on eu ping,it's not something u want,i'll just make something crystal clear,i don't try in tournaments,ever,if u want me to try, i will,but you'll legit quit the game,once u realize onslaught has no weakness,the weakness is SUPPOSED to be me,because im so lazy,but if i play seriously,im as good as they are,ur joking right?,i told u already,i'll crush you,aderall is unnecessary,trying isn't either,we'll win even if i just hold m1 and hit counters,it makes no impact,nothing,they'll get johns about counter heavy comps on ping,what of it,if they win, we can play one on NA too,i think that's fair,if we win on EU, there's obviously no need for a second game,ya, if i decide to,idk if my teammates are even around,i didnt mean right now,zzz,i dont care if he promised his entire shitty continent,every single european can suck my dick,if my teammates aren't here, we can't play,retard,<@158305555037945856> ninjas is a faker level prodigy,one in 10,000,000,the thing is, ninjas is ONLY 1 in 10 million,it's impressive for most people,but much worse than me,im one in 7.8 billion,world's greatest,period,don't make me laugh,there's nothing im not the best at,anything i put even a miniscule amount of effort into i crush everyone at,there's no competition for me anywhere on earth,at anything,im from another world,the future is an apocalypse,where i rule,im literally the harbinger of the apocalypse,but like, wayyyyyyyy sicker,nowadays it isn't the same,the NA scene is better than EU,it took forever,EU became worse,and NA has 2 solid teams that aren't us,3 good teams is definitely more than EU has,ur such a nitpicker,do u not understand my expectations can't be met,they are good,but they're "not bad" compared to me,aka trash,but they're definitely still better than you,if i go to dreamhack,im entering SSBM,fuck battlerite,me vs mang0 grand finals,LETS go,"a samus main",the #1 samus on earth,u mean,lol,i mean not rly, he's worse than plup,ya,but plup's plup,im also SUPER homies with plup,love that guy,what's it like being 45 years old,i'll never know,since im perpetually 14,and it's fucking raw,like i give a fuck,ima become a pro poker player,when im bored of gaming,i made soooooo much money playing poker a couple years ago,quit because of a loophole,shit was mad gay,but no loopholes exist in person,and it's even easier to rob people in person,ya, a loophole with the site i used,i was def running 8 tables at once,16 hours a day,<:reddKreygasm:284219897695961089>,literally me,can do anything i want whenever i want to do it,i just don't,cause im lazy AF,sometimes it's hard being born so talented,i have so many options that i'm often forced into inaction,cus i can't do everything i want to do,not enough hours,the problem is im capable of literally anything, but being the best at something is the worst i'll settle for, which is a large time investment even for me,so it's like,im not gonna half-ass it and not be a god,i only

acknowledge ability that the region doesn't have,acknowledging that those below me are the same as me is an insult,lol,who cares about what's manly,im god,i dont care about anyone or anything,im the ultimate being,literally who cares,what anyone else says or thinks,except me,in any context,nah,game's laggy,plus,it's the 2nd/3rd best champ against shifu,and we're double melee,chance of winning even on 0 ping is 0%,BR isn't a game of skill, it's a game of comp,in 2v2,there is no way to win,with perfect play,jumong IS bad,horrible actually,i dont think he's even dealt damage to me,since the patch,,cus ezmo is OP,and taya sucks,that's all,u know what's funny actually,iva is also overpowered,but she's so overshadowed by ezmo,she looks fine,because they're the same champ,but ezmo's better at everything,LOL,ezmo is so op averse is gonna play it,that's how u KNOW,flick away from what counters?,he just walked backwards and spammed e,impossible to close the gap against 2 shields which both knock back, zap cleanse clarity cleanse panic,he literally didnt use M1,cus ezmo doesn't use m,m1,it's just like oldur,he simply walks backwards until u do something,cus u have no choice,and him m2ing ur counter doesn't actually let u punish him,in fact,nothing in the game lets u punish ezmo,nothing,lol,me losing in any circumstance that is fair, ever,is impossible,in any game,in any competition,anywhere,any time,no,they had ezmo and we didn't,and had iva and we didn't,instant loss,what about it,ssbm is SICK,ya,averse is learning ezmo right now,good isn't the right word,it's game breaking,which is why u stood a chance,that's all,agree,ezmo unbeatable,that said,i've said ezmo was unbeatable by melee for like,3 or 4 patches at least,probably more like 6 honestly,and we had 2 melees,guaranteed loss,but we still won,despite guaranteed loss,cus huge skillgap,<@208693717563998209> 8%,i actually went to defend joltz there,to say only real comp counts,then i thought to myself,i could defend this from nikita's pov too,who's right,?????,circlejerk,ya,ur entire retarded continent flooded my chat nonstop,fk u and ur chat,and ur mother,*spit*,what are u talking about,nikita gives the most valuable thing of all,his glorious existence,i told u,whatever region im breathing in is the best region,always, in all things,all that was proven is that ezmo and iva are so strong they can destroy the best team in the world without a decent healer,that's all that was proven,nobody's better than anyone,lol,ya she pressed space on ezmo,and ezmo 1v3'd,literally spamming zap and space on ezmo,and he 1v3'd our comp,sooooo insanely broken,there's no such thing,as competing,i don't participate in "competitions",as soon as i enter,it's over,there's a 0% chance of anyone else winning,i wouldn't "compete" with eu,i'd win so onesidedly,that the entire competitive scene of the game would instantly die,and the game would tank,and then i'd take my money and leave,and never play again,worth,even with no arms and legs i'd destroy eu,what do u mean? i didnt challenge them,we were banting in the discord like we do literally 24/7,to and about literally everyone on earth,and i said joltz sucks we'd smash him,on eu ping,a CLEARLY facetious statement,that's also true if he didnt play ezmo,and verosk turned it into a shitpost,so we played for fun,nobody actually cares about the outcome,it was averse's first game of the day ffs and all of the rounds we lost were him getting instakilled from tazer 3 seconds in,give me a break,i dont care what you say about averse,onslaught,NA,anything,I am better than all of YOU,objectively,by a ton,nikita, no u won't,the comp is unbeatable,the only hope against it is jade, and yours isn't good enough,so u lose,huge skillgap won't matter,if u play a bad comp,as was proven just now,i mean, we still won,but there's a ping difference AND we're by far the best players on earth,like by farrrrrrr the best,on an even playing field, nobody can beat that comp,it's ridiculously op,lol,it's better than oldur croak ashka,because the engage is tazer,and it bounces,but still instakills like a croak combo,plus they have more shields, more dispells, more cc,that comp is NUTS,lol,ya averse got gripped,because he wasn't playing ezmo,so he's gonna play ezmo,to avoid getting countered by ezmo,what do u mean,averse can beat anyone with any champ,EXCEPT ninjas,on literally any champ,>not doing 13 reps to push past the pain barrier arnold talks about in Pumping Iron,>LUL,verosk,wtf are u talking about,we haven't dropped a game in a month,LOL,struggling relative to normal, we've actually never been so dominant,we win 5-2 5-3 in finals,that is "struggling" for us,lol,like,winning 10-5 is terrible for us,a disgusting outrage,we've 10-0'd or 10-1'd every match for like,the last 3 weeks,except that one,that's why we were "struggling",cus it took 20 minutes longer than usual,for some reason,well yeah,me and averse don't play at all,like,AT all,but even without playing we're more than good enough,i still dont feel nearly threatened enough to consider practicing,and i probably wont for another couple months,BR has turned into rocket league for me, the game is so unfun, poorly balanced, boring, frustrating, and generally overall bad,that even with money, esports, fame, etc as an incentive, I can't find the motivation to practice the game,meaning im destined to get worse forever,so once the onslaught contracts ends, i may end up quitting,and honestly i'll probably be having a lot more fun with the extra free time,can go to my SSBM weeklies that are at the same time as PRL,BR right now is a job,not like, a full time job,but if i want to NEVER lose, i have to practice like it's a full time job,and even practicing at all to stay decent is like part-time work,why not just go get part-time work,more enjoyable,more money,lol,i regretted it for RL,and then i went back, after i saw the scene,i played for not joking,maybe 20 minutes,uninstalled,NEVER played again,the worst part was, i was actually still amazing at RL,when i went back,i was SO good,but i hated it,like hated everything about it,it'll probably be that way for BR too,i've crossed the threshhold of playing when i don't want to too much already,and won't ever enjoy it again,i've tried many times, but eh,it sucks,game just really really sucks,every patch is worse than the last,been that way for so long,well because nerfing croak has made way for the monster croak's bullshit spammable spit kept in check,fucking ezmo,nothing counters ezmo,except ezmo,if u think anything does, ur shit,which i already knew,actually,so correct,sirius shifu takes 6 rounds vs iva ezmo lucie,top kek,what are u talking about,they don't ATTACK,lol,ezmo just e's,and everyone else just jacks themselves off standing around,cus they have 2 shields and 2 cleanses,NEVER have to go in,takes 0 poke,even if they hit counters they don't take damage,what part of 2 shields 2 cleanses dont u get,i incapped lucie when she had zap AND barrier on her, waited it out, went to punish her and i was SOLO dead to ezmo,in under 5 seconds,like what?,no,shifu is bad and ezmo's broken,<@121630407782432769> ya no post about me thx,im gonna get enough shit about this half-serious for fun match,that was actually a 1-1,like IM gonna get shit because averse got tazer stunned into m2 and instantly died 2 rounds in a row,as is,are u kidding?,did any of you fucking retards think the match was serious?,if so please speak up now,because im blocking you and we're never speaking again,i can't BELIEVE anyone could be that stupid,<@221024427456856064> ya, no choice but to counter,we have no poke and they have 2 shields,can't engage on them,shifu if he lands a spear get's m2'd during the spear endlag,because thet exists for some reason,ya joltz i know,cus we made no mistakes,so,^,literally,nothing that has happened,has any relevancy to anything,verosk started a shitpost because he has autism,and now i get shit,for his autism,verosk shut the fuck up,forever,in a ditch,thanks,<:4Head:270254106164068365>,autism is far worse,being born that way isn't an excuse,that would be like,me being humble about how crazy talented i was born,like what,sometimes u roll the dice,and u either roll low or high,but no matter what u roll,u gotta stick to that shit,ALL,IN,ya, ezmo's gay,shit happens,u still suck and i'd fuck you at lan,so,carry on,no,cus ezmo will be nerfed by the time lan happens,ofc,lol,ezmo has singlehandedly removed melees from the meta for 6 months,he wasn't nerfed cause there were other priorities,like croak,and oldur,and jumong,(jumong lol),sorry,who're you,no he isn't,he's exactly like oldur,if he rotates his defensive skills properly, he has a 2 second window to punish his space,a 2 second window that's easily covered by his m2 being an instant cast silence that pushes you back AND snares you,or by his E rooting/weaking you for 8 seconds,or by his damage simply killing you if you get close,shifu (and all melees, actually) have no way to pierce his shield,everyone knows his shield is his "weakness",it isn't a weakness,cus he never even has to use it,just walks backward and uses e,if u get close,instant m2,if u somehow get close again,book > instakill,600 damage per second,ur 2 second window to punish him has 3 moves on ezmo's side to stop you,and that's IF you can get through the shield,which many chars (shifu included) can't,oh yeah, that reminds me actually,bakko's broken as fuck too,why would u go in as ezmo,who was that intheflesh guy who spoke earlier,he just came out of nowhere,what was the deal with that,probably a fucking jade main,randler,i wipe my ass with ur mother's tongue,i didn't say i was going to,i said,i already do,it was like,a 6/10,that doesn't surprise me,but im not gonna have a gf ever probably,so gl with that one,keep what,????,EU brain LUL,ya,i wont have a gf again probably,it's something i've done on and off for years,but i just dont find it worth the time or effort,with how arrogant i am, there's no woman who meets my standards anyway,and the only reason i'd be with a chick is to fuck her cus im hella shallow,nah,women just cry about everything constantly,and annoy the fuck out of u with their problems,since u actually dont care AT ALL about them or anything going on with them,story of my life,you've actually never met a dude colder than me,if u think im arrogant when it comes to gaming,u should see me in every other aspect of life,im SO superior to everyone,all the time,it's actually not bragging,it's just my mentality,like, i wont be with a chick because of that menality,i mean, i concur,sick, swag, etc.,but on some real talk,u can't steal my gf if i dont care about being with a chick,whatsoever,i actually always thought it was a little weird of me,can't control how i feel tho,i actually just have 0 ambition to ever go after any girl,for like any reason,she was pretty cool,but then she was the worst,cus i had to deal with her bullshit,and then i was like "oh yeah, sick.","lata",ROFLLLL,what part of,"i dont remember anything longer than 8 hours ago",did you not get,i forgot she existed,until u brought it up,i give so few fucks,about anything,lol,ya exactly bloods,you've got it 100%,i can't be with a chick,cus then i'd have to treat her like a human being,which is like,...ur kidding right,HAHAHAHA,fuck that,no,there's no chick i've ever met who's worthy to be my bitch tbh,im so swag it's unreal,and the craziest thing is where my priorities lie, even if that exist chick DID exist and was willing i'd be like "you'll probably become burdensome in the longrun so ima just grind out some maplestory",actual straight gangster,<:PogChamp:282891715810033665>,realcouncil is a place for shod out legends,like me,and joltz,and zab,,1 1 9,joltz,do NOT stick ur dick in tap,🚷,https://youtu.be/6XBn83tVJqM,N I N E,M

million,im 1,of a kind,ima TRIPLE OG,he's condom,im racoon,i win,ez,well,my mechanical skill was way way above him,like, 4 months ago,i just can't make myself practice anymore,like, i actually try to brute force practice when i don't enjoy it,and im like "how long have i been streaming? couple hours?",it's like 35 minutes,shit is just GRATING,i actually hate it,honestly the queue times are what's killing me,i can't commit to doing anything else, cause they aren't quite that long,but they're so long still that i don't want to play by the time they find a match,ya i used to do that,1 mistake = death,like 15 seconds later or so,o NO,NOOOOOOO,he knows lol,he's in the same boat, actually,both of us are sticking with it for the money,but i dont have the patience,so i probably will quit and not care,even if there is money,oh yeah no,im the most talented player to ever live,i dont actually care about being seen as a legend or esports icon,at all,cus i know i am,every minute of every day,...,?,why would i need to progress anywhere,or advance anywhere,there's nowhere to go from the top,i dont need to prove im at the top to be at the top,i simply am,the world,^,because i observe the world around me,and i can simply see it,you don't?,Nope,that's valien,he just spammed me 2 seconds ago,fortunately i had foresight and called him a fag in 0.2 seconds,and he went "albino nigger" of course,i bopped him,SO hard,literally didnt even click the link,world's smartest man,honestly, im kinda surprised i figured it out LOL,apparently,it's macros,people asked him,he said he doesnt have the time to spam people nonstop,so he has scripts do it for him,ikr?,i really preferred the idea of like,a legendary super saiyan 12 year old arakune,cus like, what he's doing,i did,for like,probably 3 STRAIGHT continuous years,from like age 9-12,it was fucking SICK,and then i like, went outside and played soccer,was actually way sicker,true story,ROFL,NO KLORNY NO,i was just expecting some porn or something racist or some gore,or something,LUL,im so,not surprised,he's actually 12 year old arakune,what a fucking legend,oh i blocked and deleted the message like,forever ago,im too fast for that shit,i took it seriously,but it was averse's first game of the day and we were double melee vs iva ezmo,can't rly outplay,lol,nah,im still better,just do what i always do,wait for ezmo nerf,destroy everyone after,like i care,i'll just play whoever's op,welcome to gaming,i just cant play ezmo cause im our melee,ya,but i dont play ranged in any game,on principle,cus it's gay and unfun to run and camp,dont like it,it would work in our comp if i played it tho,but averse is gonna instead,so it's fine,ya,i respect that mentality nikita,im just stubborn,would rather lose and complain,than play ranged,lol,verosk,isn't that just,being better than everyone else,u just have others do menial tasks for u so u can do whatever u want,constantly,sounds like he's spending his time well,PFFFFF,WHAT

idea,see this is what i mean,u act like u accomplish something by 'triggering me",it's something i decide to do,what u said actually had no impact on anything,i was going to flame u no matter what,looks fine on my screen,i bet you,10 billion dollars,i have a bigger dick and higher IQ than anyone in the entire continent of europe,bet 10 billion,9.5 on a bad day,u should see me when i beat EU teams,blankz, i was talking about that the other day actually,isn't it sad when one man has so much talent that much of it is useless?,no, no,not the not interested in dating thing,the "im too good at everything" thing im talking about right now,i have a 9.5 inch dick and a 140 IQ on top of everything else i have going for me,and i'll never use either of them,because i literally don't want to,too much other shit going on,not interested at all,honestly don't even think i'll give a shit about women or education in like,15 years,im a man with so much potential,that i can do anything,and it's not at the top of my priority list,or close,that's ALSO,not at the top of the list,,gtfo with ur "weebs" shit,it's a 2010 meme,i agree,eygrr u know what,i VERY much appreciate that,especially the part about music,i take a ton of pride in my music taste,it's SUPER diverse and super deep,i used to have friends who'd ask me for music recommendations every day,like, a dozen of them. which is a lot for something so specific,but then i just stopped talking to them,cause they SUCK,everything from metal to kpop to hip hop to alternative to dnb to classical,i listen to literally every genre,i have not,what genre?,also,i might secretly be like a 14 year old girl somehow cus of this (just what i've heard somehow),but to date the best album i've ever heard was by Dance Gavin Dance,it's the only album i've ever heard where i enjoyed more than like, 2 songs,and there's like 8 bangers on that album,actually legendary,this one song has the 2nd best intro in any song ever made,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-aQrBZ4Duw,best intro to any song ever,well, 2nd best,the 1st one is japanese

Different passwords for every site, normally different users as well,the problem was once my email password was leaked, he simply used "forgot my password" reset links to get into EVERYTHING else,so it didn't matter how good my security was,i have like, 3 step on a lot of stuff now,can't even get into my email or bank account without calling somene,someone*,soooo,i mean, worth,but also hope he's good,that's called security,even if someone gets my password they can do NOTHING with it,can't be too careful,i mean obviously it's still possible to hack me,but you'd have to be pretty skilled,well, it's fine,i dont use my email anyway,same,i check my email periodically,but i dont use it that much,same with bank accounty,saving money :dansgame:,got hacked in 2016,in my defense,the dude was actually like,extremely malicious,and was known for hacking people in the osu community,he had hacked like 6 people before me,and hacked 3 more people after me,dude was a mega dickhead,the giant yahoo password leak,he went on one of those sites,paid like 5 dollars,and literally saw my password,it was all LEAKED,but i didnt know it was leaked,because it was leaked in 2010,and they announced it was leaked,in late 2016,thanks yahoo,they lost, quote; "Billions of account passwords",billions,LITERALLY their words,how are there even billions of accounts,?????,why would i change my password per arbitrary amount of time when it's been proven it's secure,i mean, it was secure, the shit just got leaked,lol,and if it was in the news or some shit like it should've been,i would've changed it then, obviously,???,u have autism or something?,there's literally no reason to change a password that nobody else has ever gotten into,there's no lmfao about that you retard,it's literal common sense,that's LITERALLY true,but it was a 1 in 10 billion chance,not only was EVERY password on yahoo leaked,yahoo didn't tell anyone it was leaked,AND someone malicious was after me specifically,who also knew it was leaked,literally 1 in 10 billion,would never happen again,to anyone,i wont show u the math, but 1 in 10 billion is an extremely conservative estimate,it's more like 1 in infinity,who cares,i have 3 step,🤔,take my password, like i give a shit,can't do anything with it,i would know,because i can't do anything with it,i mean that's not actually true,there's def some things u can do with it,but nothing super horrifying,my password was pretty close to that,good ol' 2007 runescape,now my password is so obscenely niche and complicated nobody could ever possibly get it,for example, the osu one for a while was like,so the osu titlescreen says "clickthecircles",so mine was that,but instead of circles, triangles,because who would ever click triangles,and then a ton of arbitrary numbers representing random things,and all of my passwords are basically that,u could never guess them in 10 billion years,like 6 or 7,lol,20 character password or something,LOL,actually laughed so hard at that,ya it's a pretty solid password,none of my other ones are THAT complex,but they're all complex enough,like i dont know that,u think i dont know how brute forcing works,knew about that shit when i was 11,im saying they're unguessable,and un-bruteforce-able,which is as secure as u can get basically,https://youtu.be/raY-vZ3Ox6o,FOREVER,FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEYEAH,<:reddKreygasm:284219897695961089>,ROFL,this clip someone took from my

think that's the first tourney more than 1 player has played bad,most of the time it's me, some of the time it's averse, but i always carry with ninjas when it comes down to it,idk what happened,joltz,i actually agree so much,my focus went from 10% to 200%,im fucking pissed,still dont feel like myself though,gonna take some practice,DansGame,im playing like,a 6/10 right now,which is

our shifu 1v1,reverse swept him,5-2,AAAAAAAAAAAAAA,,the definition of reverse sweeping someone is to be losing, and then to win every single round after until you win,namely, starting from 0 points

dick in esports,tbh,he's the best SOLDIER 76 i've ever SEEN,,119 that's the curse,1,1,9,that's the ssbm community,REAL ass dudes,implying anyone in the ssbm community even shaves or showers or goes outside,the game is SO hard,and the competition is SO strong,u dedicate ur life to ssbm,and the 119,the curse,and the blessing,,,etc,eh?,it's a tampa thing SON,i rep it till i DIE,u dont know about the 119,you'll never know about it,because u gotta BE about it,why is jin,SO gangster,never seen a more thug motherfucker,i dont,i copy/pasted from reddit,ur welcome,owo,my victory is assured,they stand no chance,joltz,i meant to tell u,we played vs that exact comp yesterday,round 1,shifu ezmo pearl,on top of that, it was the best solo queue players in NA for the respective champs,but we crushed them,shifu sirius taya,it wasn't the comp, we were just better than them,but, i agree with you,double ranged sucks vs that,It's weird in BR, if the skill levels are just a decent amount apart, comp doesn't really matter at all,but as soon as the skill is close, it's like 90% of the game,ya, actually joltz that's some advice for u too,we learned we actually prefer open maps to closed ones, which sounds counterintuitive for a melee rushdown comp, but it actually isn't,you don't have to chase them down, you can simply split them off and then the size of the map doesn't matter, and having the extra room to dodge skillshots and not get blown up by aoe in chokes is really nice,tldr: big maps are good for aggro comps,not small,we felt way more comfortable on blackstone and skyring night than on like orman or araz,but your results may vary,also look at jin,this GANGSTER motherfucker,,so gangster,any champ who's got a lot of aoes and is difficult to disengage from is better on smaller maps, obviously stuff like freya is obvious, but you wouldn't expect stuff like pest, ashka, oldur, etc,u really really suffer on small maps vs them,u were outcomped and they had better players,don't read into it so much,You're better than them, but nikita and corrupted are better than ur teammates for sure,which is something you aren't factoring,the biggest rason we lost on tuesday was because of skill difference, not comp or map,it's the same for you,even if you didn't get outplayed,Then worry about your play before you worry about your comp,That's what we're doing today, we're playing the same thing we lost with because we're convinced despite the bad matchup that we can beat them if we step up our teamwork and individual play,you shouldn't make big sweeping changes when it may be as simple as nikita and corrupted outplaying your teammates,i mean, u should play what u want,and i agree ur comp was losing there,but im just saying that isn't necessarily all there is to it,if it was me, i'd be tempted to just blame those things, play a new champ and continue to be lazy,but it's not the best way,Jin vs Hand Of God,most hype thing,i've ever seen,nyy didn't hit any of my trances,kept getting double stuns with his e,fuuuuuuuuck,played so shitty the last couple weeks,no excuse man,zzz,ya, he was until yesterday,i got fucking mad,u won't like me when im angry,96% winrate,actually higher, it was 96% on my smurf,went 9-0 on my main too,man nujabes has so many songs,but only a few of them are my kind of music,i wonder if there's an easy way to sort through,i agree joltz,unless ur against your comp, or croak/ashka/oldur,playing truly aggressive against that is impossible,it's guaranteed instant death the second you go in,no champ in the game has enough ways out,even if you hit everything, you die,there's no such thing as mechanically gifted,im the most mechanically skilled player there is, and I sucked ass 3 days ago literally from not practicing,i promise you,im currently unstoppable,there's nobody in the world who can beat me,whatever you say,you'll see it today when we smash unsung,and unsung is just a significantly stronger version of PH,so,beating them's tough,I didn't say they were,they're like 3rd or 4th though, and that comp is absurd,all 3 players on unsung are better than the PH counterparts,and their teamwork is arguably better too,rotations, 1v1s, cd management, positioning, aim, everything,they're just better,OWO,im listening to this,https://youtu.be/1DTNJJ1rr2A,i mean nujabes is one of the most legendary artists in history,im sure i'll find a ton of his songs i like,he just has so many, i just started listening to them,chalt is better than hotbiscuit by a ton,i've played them both a lot,"but na ping",no,u can tell the difference,despite ping,his mindgames and such aren't on the same level,i lost my first game of the day,zzzzzzz,this is what happens when you sleep 2 hours,wake up from nightmare,don't go back to sleep,i was just 1v2 vs ashka and jade, both of them were 70% hp, i was 80%,I won with 93% hp left,what the actual fuck,shifu is INSANE,verosk,that's not true, u just aren't living every moment LITERALLY ready to die,if the bar falls on you, you were too weak,oh trust me, ik about the gym,i used to bench like 350 in my prime,TRUST me,well the 9-13 reps are how u get extremely jacked, according to arnold,joltz,want to play?,i've been wanting to play with friends in pubg for a couple days,my other crew's been busy,so stacked ROFL,level 1 vest in solo though <:wutface:285104381819355136>,sucks so bad when you just get kar'd out of nowhere with your 6 first aid kids and insta-die,and you're like "oh ok cool",joltz, u wish to play,pls,papa,in my defense,i played on EU 2 games ever with nikita,and both games i got like 3-4 kills,which wasn't great,but y'know, better than my NA average,also yeah, i hear NA servers are better in pubg even for EU people,just what i heard,but i've had some problems with them,the problems with the game still happen, random "host disconnected" and random crashes and stuff,still occur on NA,only thing that turns me off the game tbh,quess,owo,let's get it,played 1 game with joltz and eoekas,and won,PogChamp,im drinking at 8 am,swag,america SWAG,H E L L A,would've also settled for "sooooooooooo broken",u smell,ashka/croak/oldur,real talk,long ccs, easy giant aoe followups,mid control u cant mess up,doesn't require reactions cus they all have amazing spaces,etc,this nyy is heal very suck,going to destroy chalt's team,just woke up,10 STRAIGHT rounds,i just destroyed stro,5-0,that's what the FUCK,im TALKING ABOUT,we were actually popping off,yelling and slamming shit,every round we won,im fucking HYPE,get DICKED,10 STRAIGHT ROUNDS!

played,go study that fucking vod for the next 20 years to discover the riddle of the sphinx,cause we fucking figured it out,,we beat the best team in the tourney 10 rounds straight,finals won't be as hard.,and we popped off because we were down 3-0,and reverse 10-0'd,plus they beat us 5-0 last time,super saiyan level 2,i actually ascended,lol,<:feelsSomethingman:285783203913138187>,,im friends with a pornstar,i had a long convo with her about becoming one myself,but turns out everything's in cali, and the pay's super trash for male pornstars,so i was like "fuck that, im tryna get paid for this all american dick",nah like, it's actually a true story,i only know her because of ssbm actually,lul,rook cant,but RK definitely can,I think he's decent for sure,poloma's definitely one,cus he already has 30 iframes,and good sustain,then again, poloma works with literally anyone,because poloma gives him even more iframes and sustain,and he's rly good at peeling for her,well poloma's broken,so she's good for anyone,simply with her existence,if you can manage a comp that isn't "bad" for poloma,you should use poloma always,although, im beginning to think pearl's pretty retarded,ninjas said he wants to try pearl shifu,which is a pretty known comp,for being good,pearl and shifu synergize well tho,both can handle themselves,make individual plays,we did,lol,ofc,?,are u implying someone else could win when we're trying,that's a bad joke,yeah, they did,and we smashed them,it was a mistake on their part,they wanted to play on US southeast,everyone on our team has 20 ping,bakko is lowkey so strong,he wins short term trades SO onesidedly,can disengage with R whenever it's up without taking poke,no sustain sucks, but besides that he's actually nuts,tons of cc, tons of guaranteed damage combos, good at kiting, good mid control,and with R he's legit invincible,ya,i think he's stronger,shifu just has more mechanical outplay room,If shifu doesn't hit bulwark, and shifu's counter is hit, bakko still wins the trade if he has R up,just so we're 100% clear on that,and it's not as close as you'd think either,he does about twice as much damage to shifu as shifu does to him,lol,given, he then has no R,and the next trade is in shifu's favor,but bakko's really good at running away,so u dont get a second trade,ya iska, that's a good idea,i do that but then he gets saved by teammate or something and it's still a loss for shifu,shifu needs R to engage,disengage*,ya, i think so too,been saying for a while that he's really strong,he's also probably the best melee with poloma, which has merit in and of itself,since she's so strong,ULU,ya zab, rly good word to describe it,even when u outplay him and kick the shit out of him, he just doesn't take damage and you do,feels like u only hit him to gain energy,and then ur ult tears him apart,but yeah,well if he goes the bulwark weaken right,rite*,he's suddenly insane vs melee,like 100-0 matchup vs all of them,u basically just play like ashka, bulwark and if it doesn't hit you shield dash backwards,if someone like shifu spears you to follow, E away,if he still follows, space,u just run forever,it's so annoying,bakko being a strong champ in this meta,ur thoughts hansa?,just is,if you've played against him recently you'd "feel it",just trades absurdly well, lots of cc, good at picking fights and kiting,he's extremely annoying to kill,ya, but even bad bakko players feel tough to deal with,he's very forgiving,which sounds counterintuitive, given the "0 sustain" thing,but his healer just camps him,and he's soooo forgiving,it's not like u lose to bakko and he kills u,it's like, u outplay him, then he R's and kicks the shit out of you for 70 damage while taking 0 himself and runs away,it's true for croak too,ya, but freya's trance is literally gamebreakingly strong.,It's the only move in the whole game where hitting it can get your teammate killed,if croak hits my freya trance and I space on oldur, he's dead,because it puts static on him for some reason,like, wtf is that,sounds retarded LOL,5-1 5-4,and we played really sloppy and lazy,the best team in the tourney was semis,so we didn't really care once we beat them,like, u have no idea,we actually played so bad in the final,and won 2-0 somehow,rofl,bro,i had enough of unsung's shit,super saiyan level 2,in that final,semi*,unsung,the ones who've 5-0'd PH 3 times in a row with their own comp,jeter/chalt/stro,we were losing 3-0 game 1,and they beat us 5-0 last time we played map 3,and then we reverse 10-0'd them,10 QUICK ones,he got 39 score in one of the rounds in finals yesterday,and me and ninjas almost won 2v3,LOL,had like 1300 score each,me and ninjas actually won a few rounds where averse got like 200 score,ninjas is beast,ya they tried,and then i used the best tactic of all,"be better than the opponent",and countered stro's petrify 9 rounds in a row,literally took it 0 times,i used the hidden technique,get fucking ANGRY,the way our comp usually rotates is 2 different 2v1's,so it was me vs chalt/stro,and ninjas/averse vs jeter,and i was like winning 2v1,going so ham,i stand by that that semi is the best i've ever played,i was looking like superman,i unbanned you,you fucking shit smeller,ROFL,im the goat,A R N O L D,9 T O 1 3 R E P P A I N B A R R I E R,the worst is when ur playing a ranged champ,like jumong,and u space backwards,and RIGHT at the end of ur space,ur teammate hits freya counter,and u get sucked HALFWAY across the map,into it,and die,as in nyy,ur the teammate playing perfectly,ur teammate fucks up,and u die,sirius DOESN'T have a trance,only ninjas' sirius does,champ fuckin sucks,rook's melee,so is sirius,nikita if sirius gets buffs,it's the end,sirius is actually so overpowered,he just requires a lot of teamplay,sirius probably requires more teamwork than any other char except like, maybe poloma,can't do anything by himself,but with his teammates he's a god,>release lucian in LoL,>thanks riot games,he was only the best champ in the game,for like,6 months,and by 6 months i mean like 16 months,thanks sls,alright well, i haven't grinded MS in like 3-4

times btw,by both sides,oh, i've actually never cared any less,it was 1-1, as anticipated. nobody won,but for some reason reddit took it ULTRA serious,and quoted me saying there was no way in 10 billion years they could win,and then the fact that we "lost",when we didn't,it was a tie,zzz,but, u can't convince retards of anything,nah, IM a man of the people,in fact,i did a 2 hour interview

yes,probably,lol,taya might be 2nd,sirius 3rd,iva is rly good still, top 5,ezmo nerfed into the ground after permasnare is gone,shifu crushes him,pest was rly annoying too,also got nerfed into the ground,everything that was a threat to shifu/sirius got nerfed,it's just like it was 3-4 months ago,shifu isn't really op for any reason,EVERYTHING else got nerfed,and he's the only one left,lol,ya,i literally shoot heroin into my veins,then i pick shifu,and go,AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA,and win,<:pogCh:313335558967525377>,i went,AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA,at averse,and neewha,and literally every player,and won,sure,im gonna probably go for rank 1 global tonight,need 300 more points,got 700 points yesterday,ya,climbed 5 divisions,and got 200 points,lol,,im not bragging or anything,ppl just always ask the score,so i post it,dont rly want to,it's too frustrating,countering and then getting hit through it,cus if ur counter gets baited u just die,lol,i mean, i guess we can play 1,invite me,i did,o.o,?,ok,im destroying nikita,on EU north,shifu vs bakko,o,ok!,,won on EU,ggs nikita,hmu any time u wanna practice,ur looking rusty,but ur still way better than most people,the practice still helps me,it's all about mindgames,i told u tho,when the time comes that there's a threatening team in NA, i'll try my hardest and show that im the best player,back when we played, i wasn't even playing outside tournaments,but i played 8 hours yesterday,of course i won,it's not as bad as you think,bakko has better mid control,bakko ult is rly strong, and if ur counte r ever gets baited he ex spaces at you > you're forced to space,and he can follow with snare axe > e > m1,for like 70 damage,outtrades you heavily with R, so if he ever iframes/bulwarks/dodges your R, he can run train on you,it's a closer matchup than people think,I've said for a long time that bakko is actually really good against shifu,i don't think he beats him, cus shifu is the melee 1v1 king,but he's probably the best melee against him except maybe RK,not if u have R,something i see too much is bakko using bulwark when they have their R up,like why, ur broken as fuck,just hit me in the face,and i can't do ANYTHING except cc/run,can't fight him at all,well,i incapped you right as you r'd like,50 times,you had a habit with when you used it,so i was predicting it,it's just a thing in fighting games, even if you're aware you're getting punished for doing something, you can't really think of a good alternative to what you're doing and continue to make the same mistake,Every player has habits, and "skill" is just the ability to adapt faster than your opponent,ofc,the benefit of shifu is that he doesn't need a healer,ya,i didnt even read the raigon patch notes,how is his Q different now?,ability seems different,but i can't figure it out,and i never lose to him anyway,i know imoshen,i commentated a tourney with him in it,u destroyed him with jade,<:pogCh:313335558967525377>,i hate being a melee vs freya in solo queue,my retard jade hits the counter,i get spaced and die,like why,like i can kill her just fine,until my teammate hits her counter,rofl,,60:40 shifu,maybe 55:45,but i think 60:40,of course, that's only in 1v1 shifu wins 60:40. In an actual match like 3v3 with teammates, i think they're about even,bakko bodyblocks super hard so u can't fight the people u actually wanna fight, with his weaken, armor after space, shit like poloma 50% damage reduction, R, etc,he takes 0 damage,So bakko basically infinitely trades with u in 3v3 while walling u off important targets,he shuts down shifu's pressure,u place urself inbetween shifu and healer,press R,and hold down m1,and shifu can't do anything to u,oh ya that's the other thing nikita,weaken is way better against shifu than snare axe is,weaken is actually crazy good,idk why u went snare,it's much better vs anyone with high sustain, since it makes them unable to avoid taking max hp damage,so obviously shifu is one, but stuff like RK, any healer,like half the cast,it's amazing against,well,the only downside to it is that the recast is so short,it's a guaranteed counter,i could counter the weaken in my sleep,but, then if u start making a mindgame out of it where you bulwark and simply DONT use the weaken afterwards,shifu has to counter on prediction,and he eats shit,u didn't do it at all, actually,and to be fair,i've NEVER seen ANY bakko do it,there's definitely more people could be doing with that char,the people who play him aren't good enough,nah, even weredeer hits every counter,he sometimes takes the ashka approach of recasting away from shifu and then spamming axes,which is annoying,but if you just wait for it and land jav on him he's gonna take a ton,the big issue with bakko for shifu isn't that shifu kills him, actually shifu can't ever kill him,it's that he has such little mobility that he's forced to tank shifu's ex space and R,in other words,shifu double ults ur team in 3 seconds,and there's nothing u can do,but if u save incap/weaken for it, u SHOULD hypothetically be able to remove that threat,but people always worry about punishing shifu's space,not his ult,when his ult is the real gamechanger,in the tourney yesterday i had more than 5 rounds where i ulted once for over 200 damage,cus i was double/triple incapping into triple ult,over and over,if u dont wanna read then dont,im telling u how to win matchup,😄,goodnight nikita,<:feelsnikitaman:284752940290539531>,nikita,smell bad,smell,cus time is irrelevant for russians,piss drunk at 7 am,<:wutface:285104381819355136>,i dont have enough tokens,for new raigon skin,shows how little i played LOL,uh,i have like,about the same nikita,4500~,3300 on shifu,ya,im the nightmare,my shifu is 70% winrate,with 2500 games,wtf LOL,ya but i literally only play solo queue,with my teammates in 2v2/3v3 i've played a grand total of probably like,100 games,over every season,lol,no,im playing shifu rook,vs ezmo/taya,🔫,we won 3-0 in like,2 minutes,<:LUL:269941798107873286>,,me irl,G O U K I,averse thought it was round 3 when it was round 2,died instantly,we didn't 10-0,shameful

up, i'll be 4th,like i give a fuck,im the best player in the world rn,dont need to warmup,2 1/2 hours,we got some time,i'll prolly leave 45~ minutes before tourney,for a quick warmup,nah,or,stream what,pubg or the tourney?,i streamed the last one,but uh,ya sure,he's been asking me a ton of questions about sirius in PM,probably wants to mimic our style,doesn't surprise me that someone finally wanted to,it's a good strat,if u cant beat em,u know,jumong is SO bad vs rushdown on this patch,probably the weakest in the game against it,lol,he just dies instantly if shifu or freya is even in the game,has 0 opportunity to play the game,that sounds about right,so is there pubg or nah?,eoekas is ingame rn,btw, do u guys play NA servers or stick to EU,u get no opportunity to spam traps,u die before u even get ur 3rd auto off,even 1v1,ya,he's unplayable rn,except in 2v2 with pestilus specifically,in any other scenario (except like lucie/iva, something that can peel stupidly hard for him) he's horrible,but then that leaves those champs vulnurable,so it's not really worth it,especially for lucie,well, trust me, people in NA really tried jumong,he just sucks a lot,I don't even think i've lost a round against jumong,he's rly bad, especially against shifu,and shifu's nuts,it's actually weird, shifu is so good at rushing down and 1v1ing, and jumong is so good at kiting and 1v1ing, one being strong basically instantly makes the other one weak,Like jumong's insane kiting made shifu weaker than he should've been for a long time,and now it's the opposite,he can't survive,ya shifu's easily the #1 champ in the game,he's unbelievably strong,he can win a 1v2 from full hp and live with like half,lol,ya, shifu has no weakness,even that comp isn't that bad,it's worse than most comps, but shifu does fine,but it is,cus shifu has the fastest energy gain,and his incap covers half the map,free double/triple incaps into triple ult,round 3 in particular there's nothing anyone can do to stop him,he gains energy SO fast,space > 1 rotation > r > m2 > ult,well, u guys don't have any good shifus in EU,ya, the issue is that shifu's spear burns a cooldown,shifu's space burns a cooldown,and his ult burns a cooldown,combine this with his insane self healing and disruption,and his teammates just run train on you,i had a situation vs excel wizards last week where i was 1v3 in the bottom right corner of the map,and i burned not joking 5 cooldowns at once,ninjas just came over the wall and ulted and then i incapped and the round was over,varesh/polo/bakko,it's more annoying than u think,but i don't think it's that strong,nah,u ignore varesh,kill poloma,we have sirius,lol,no reason to ever focus varesh,nah,we destroy ashka,poloma lacks the mobility to keep up with him,i seperate one of them > kill the other,u underestimate shifu's mobility,same scenario,ashka cannot survive against shifu/sirius,definitely the easiest range to kill,kill lucie,well, no,even when lucie outplays me 1v1,like,lucie is REALLY hard to kill for shifu,maybe the hardest support,but, you CAN trade all yours cds for all of hers and not take much damage,and then i have ninjas,who literally 100-0 combos here in like 3 seconds,her*,probably trying to deal with averse,it's not like averse doesn't exist,he's really aggressive and he shits out damage,like, averse normally goes in before i do,he was in a 1v3 for like 40 seconds yesterday when me and ninjas kept telling him to rotate out,and he killed one of them,vs ezmo/iva/oldur,lol,don't remember,they were good NA players tho,proster is the best ezmo NA and he was on that team,i consider him one of the very best players in NA,like, top 10 for sure, probably top 5,it is for individual skill,NA doesn't have good teams, but it does have good players,ya, u never know if putting 3 good players together will magically make a super strong comp like onslaught,or whether they won't work at all,it just sort of depends,the only reason im playing is to steal rank 1 from averse for fun,now that nobody can stop me, i think i should take the glory he's been hogging this whole time,mxm sux,cus it's league but worse,and league sucks,lol, thats what u think,this nigga boosts and coaches people 24/7,most known by casters,most known by players,literally nobody ever shuts up about him,ya,real talk, there's about 15 players now globally that'll be able to compete at the highest level 100% once the game goes f2p,ninjas and averse are there, but idk if i am,i've always had to practice more than them to be the same skill,so i guess i just have to play even more,to be better,just lost my first game of the day,when i should've 3-0'd averse,countered his Q on taya 3 times in one round,my teammate has 60 score when i die 1v2,next round,he gets 4 score,next round,he gets 28 score,????????,he was TAYA,?,ONE AUTO gives u 200 score,like wtf,averse is streaming instead,we 5-0'd game 1 already,about a 6 minute match,owo,ya real talk,the sls trailers and stuff are so cringy the game would be better off without them,they look like trailers for an iphone game or something,make me actually feel bad about myself for playing it,not even joking,LOL,im like "dude battlerite is actually pretty fun",then i see the trailers,and want to hang myself,eoekas is right,lol,9 months, virtually 0 progress in any meaningful directionb,direction*,to be fair, the game feels better to play than it did 6 months ago,but not like, ridiculously better,given how long it's been,league made progress at literally 10 times the speed SLS is making it,if not even faster,lol,complaints and bugs were hotfixed within days,with weekly patches and biweekly champ releases ALWAYS,https://clips.twitch.tv/NimbleOptimisticWitchOneHand,LOL

The game modes for League and Casual as it stands do not plan to change. The goal is that Battlerite is playabale in both 3v3 and 2v2.
We are experimenting with other casual game modes and continue to do so. This may effect what other casual games modes will be available at F2P, and in the future.
To answer your question, there is no 'main' game mode, altho we appreciate that 3v3 seems to be favored for the competitive esports side, that doesn't mean there is any plans to remove 2v2 from any que. Hope this helps!,game is dead,lol,To answer your question, there is no 'main' game mode,she literally said,they have no plans to change queues,whatsoever,and no plans to decide a "main" gamemode either,despite acknowledging that esports prefers 3v3,they also intend on trying this impossible game of balancing for 2v2 and 3v3 at the same time,even though a single kit/battlerite change drastically influences certain matchups and synergies in ways that are virtually impossible to balance properly for every scenario,dooming to the game to be only rock/paper/scissors comp based forever.,this is why the USA is dope,at least we just kill eachother,instead of being killed by randoms,lost my 27 game winstreak,just now,rip,from 97% winrate,to 93%,FeelsBadMan,one piece is ultimate,if u want an entry level anime people who don't watch anime will like, probably watch samurai champloo,that show is PURE swag,https://youtu.be/QzPjm28lrNI?t=3m10s,M O N S T E R F I G H T I N G S P I R I T,Nyy, you're wrong.,Even if we lost to you, we would play taya.,we're always confident we can win with our main comp, and with the other option in jumong being so much worse this patch, it was obvious we'd stay,No, im not saying that,I'm saying if we lost a game with taya, we'd try again. We're pretty exceptional at adapting, but it's possible we'd just lose.,I dont even think it's that unlikely.,You guys are a very bad matchup for us,It depends on why we lost.,But we rarely rarely feel like comp is the problem, and if it is, it's sirius being bad, not averse's taya.,He almost never feels the "need" to switch, like me.,Our champs are strong enough,uh,i can't think of anything,k and e?,huhhhh,english was always my worst subject,kune isn't a word,but it fits dexcription,oh, ya,that instantly came to mind,but it's racist and neewha is here,so i didn't say it,neewha's my dad,so

3-5,idk what the score of game 1 was,😃,,🇰🇷,JazzLard <:pogCh:313335558967525377>,not necessary,are you in this one?,?,ya,he spaces into them 1v3,and does 70% of their hp,takes 0 of his own,because lucie/iva are down syndrome retard champs,so broken,lol,man,what a retarded comp,it's only beatable in any universe because nyy is bad,if there was an iva player better than nyy on that team, they would never lose,100% 5-0 rate,i've never seen something SO unfair,lol,How can they be angry about that loss?,there was no possible way to win,the only hope of winning was outplaying nyy and 100-0ing him,but it's not practical,with how much peel there is,given, we would've killed the fuck out of nyy,but still lost,again?,it's lucie iva ezmo,the 3 best champs,you take the 3 best champs,put them in one team,where they ALSO synergize stupidly well,and it's not op,?,shifu's the best solo champ besides ezmo,but it isn't that simple,3v3 and 2v2 are not the same game,ya joltz,im pretty confident,you guys won't ever lose again,if u guys manage to lose with that comp,you should quit,nyy,all the chars will be nerfed,or the game will die,there are only 2 outcomes,nobody wants to play in an unbeatable campy shield stacking faggot meta,it's unplayable and boring af,ya,because u play the comp wrong,why the fuck would you go in with 2 shields,are you down syndrome,just literally afk in spawn,and watch them try to kill you,while spamming taunt,and going in with that comp somehow is fun?,2 offensive AND defensive dispells, 100 shields, a movespeed steroid, a damage steroid, 3 long ranged hard ccs,sick comp,sick,as if that somehow wasn't enough, ezmo is 1st highest dps in the game and iva is 2nd,croak sucks cock,nobody cares about croak,<@!150933458414206976> i'll come to EU,i like winning without any effort,thx,im so bored,i just want worthy opponents,who don't play braindead comps,are there 0 mechanically skilled players except us?,we play like,both simultaniously the worst AND hardest comp in the game,there's nothing good about it,about ANY of the champs,they don't synergize at all,it's literally,outplay people 1v1,kill them,u act like u dont know who i am,i can do literally whatever i want whenever i want,lol,including win with anything op in a game, that's a given,why?,winning with ezmo is less fun, less impressive,winning with shifu is like,such a huge dick,9 1/2 inches EASILY,when u win tourney with shifu,iva is the worst champion on that comp, which is saying something,cus she's stupid broken,lol,ya, of course,but that's only cus of the synergy with lucie,if u replace lucie with anything else, that comp is absolute trash,oldur sux,not the same after nerf,even if iva's zap didn't dispell all positive buffs it would be broken,it's way too strong,lol,unmissable clarity potion,VERY fair,if you exist in the tractor beam u get stunned,there's nothing u can do most of the time,the worst part,is that the tractor beam stun is an instant round loss,because tractor beam stun > iva e,ensures you can't move,or do anything,you just die,like im shifu, i burn my space,tractor beam > iva e > joltz m2 > panic > lucie ult,dead,none of the abilities are difficult to aim or are even possible to miss on a cc'd target either,so braindead,it is if they're instantly guaranteed to die and there's no way to dodge the skill,are you arguing it somehow isn't op?,it's not "strong" it invalidates half the champions in the game,even shifu can't space aggressively or he instantly dies,iva and lucie both have zap?,they're both cc immune,at all times,what are u talking about,even with PERFECT play you will never cc either lucie or iva,it can't be done,nikit,u smell,owo,ya he played really smart,on one of the best champs in the game,and lost 10-1,not broken tho,mid tier at best,ok teldo,joltz,what does that even mean,im offended you'd even say that to me,how the fuck could we possibly lose,i wouldn't lose even if hell froze over,jeter and chalt are good,it's the support that sucks,stro/hudat,as long as there's 1 link on the team,they will lose,guaranteed,im the 1v1 king and the offensive pressure king,if i smell ur playing bad,u will not survive more than 20 seconds,ever,stro's extremely mechanically talented. However, in his current team's setup he's also the shot caller.,I spoke to him fairly extensively about it, and he can't focus on play and shot calling at the same time.,The last time we played them, I absolutely crushed them because i focused stro,we did that for 2 weeks straight,then stro got replaced with hudat and we do the same thing,Basically, stro is like ninjas. He's a god when he's silently focusing and playing his hardest, but he needs to communicate,I'm aware nyy,but, whether he plays or not the outcome is the same,actually, it's a lot harder with him gone,if chalt and jeter handled the communication and let the healer just play, which is exactly what me and averse do while ninjas focuses (letting healer focus is important cause it's the most dynamic and most important role, since they keep people alive + are the easiest to focus typically),then their team would be much better,with stro handling communication, he's no threat at all,they'll never beat us,well, we're like 3-4 tournies deep,and stro is getting absolutely destroyed by me,like, our matches have literally been an arakune highlight reel 1v1 vs stro, or chalt if averse outplays him,i'm getting mvp like 70% of rounds,and stro is the first one dead in 95%,then just leave klerny,they're better without you,mini is better,i made the strongest team in my region from the ground up, and my team loses without me,if u like winning, just be the reason u win,instead of getting carried,noob klerny,<@!145953821615587328> his teammates communicate when they need help or when they aggressively burn cds, while the healer plays dynamically based around map positioning and how the exchanges are going,their mechanical skill is the most important, because if they make 1 mistake they typically die,where other champs don't, since healer can save them,of course with joltz's comp, nobody can make mistakes and die, since they all have 30 ways to save eachother AND are all invincible anyway,that's why the comp is so broken,lol,there's no such thing as outplaying joltz's comp,even if you outplay them, it means nothing,you don't do damage,or cc,u just dont hurt them at all,no u can't,nothing beats it,what comp is gonna beat that,tell me,?,because the people who play this game aren't team players,who the fuck cares about your team?,i want the glory,me,fuck them,LOL,i don't want "my team is the best",i want "im the best",what's the comp?,wow that's weird,there's no comp that's good against it,LOL,havent played onslaught klerny,solo queue kings,all 3 of us,im probably the best in solo queue,averse 2nd,well, to clarify,it's no question that joltz is the best player in EU,and that klerny/mini are the best healers,Intolerant HAS always had the best players,but, not nyy,lol,ya, nyy is correct,If nyy didn't exist, intolerant would be like onslaught,objectively better than all 3 players on the other team every game,they'd smash everyone,joltz/klerny with a good 3rd will always win,same with joltz/mini,ya joltz has always been the strongest EU player in recent times,the only time was LONG ago nikita was better imo,but he's really fallen off,the same way i fell off for a couple months,well, he is,he may not be the best player, but he's the most adaptable and he's playing the best champion,that alone almost makes him the best,Joltz 999% - Today at 3:31 PM
KlernY - Today at 10:31 PM
nyy can only play braindead champs,nyy honestly,i respect u a lot more after saying that,i was there too, defnitely not top 15 a couple months ago,i think im in the top 5 again, but it was hard for me to admit when i was in a slump,it wasn't like the slump happened for any reason, i just was lazy and didn't want to play,still sucks tho,to admit ur bad,C R A Z Y,his tag is crazy,how can he lose,his tag,is,CRAZY,no, letting nikita play now is a death sentence,he sucks,but 2 months ago nikita was a monster,he's just been lazty,lazy*,nikita was almost beating me on NA 2 months ago in a matchup shifu heavily won,Now im beating him on EU in an even mu,times have changed,he's not the same nikita now,implying i do?,the first 1v1 i did in 2 months was vs nikita,and i won,so,...,no,you just have nothing to fear joltz,even if you dive into their team and burn every mobility move,you'll smash them,you have 2 shields, 2 dispells, 3 ranged cc,there's no way to lose,even if u play horrible and make every mistake possible,you'll win,lol,iva, ezmo, and lucie ALL can hit 5+ shifu counters in a row and trade evenly/better than evenly,you put all 3 on one team,what do you expect to happen,nikita,helo,<:pogCh:313335558967525377>,<:feelsnikitaman:284752940290539531>,InTheTrash93,lol holy shit,that pull alone is the worst thing i've ever seen in any game,that pull is so broken,that if i got hit by it ONE time,i'd quit the game forever,and never play again,lol,not the range,the fact that it hit completely around the wall,and didn't even hit,and somehow still sucked him AROUND THE WALL,into joltz,,<:pogCh:313335558967525377>,<:pogCh:313335558967525377>,so u suck?,i'd be down,owo,battlerekt will probably still be going on in 13 hours,smash 4?,,zab,pubg?,let's

constantly talk about "institutionalized racism" and whine about how they aren't at the top, i mean at least they know,middle east is the opposite,they're at the bottom, but THINK they're at the top,shouldn't have said it in stream chat,cus it's disrespectful to other team,but holy fuck my play was awful,i was tilting hard,really really awful,dunno how we won,i only played well like 3-4 rounds,out of 9,zzz,told you comp was gay as fuck,don't ever question what i say again,thanks,ya i will,we rape,well,that was tough,honestly,we just dunno what to do against lucie/iva,double shield is cancer,lol,dude the return iva was the exact problem,they went on averse,way better than whatever shit iva build u run,it was mega mongo,one champ immaterial nonstop with zap instant cleanse, the other is hasted like fucking taya, has barrier for himself, and then can uturn if he somehow still takes damage,that hasted uturn iva rotates SO fast,actually can't follow it,she's like,3 times as fast as taya,and taya's 2nd fastest champ in game,nah,u guys just blow,u turn iva super broken,comp still unbeatable,we're lucky we're way better than them,can't wait for nerf,braindead fucking comp,shit players,etc,,4'6,owo,battlerite has some really incredible players,obviously everyone on onslaught is really good,but mini, joltz, a handful of EU players too,i was trying to rate myself to see if i think im top 5,but im honestly not sure,im somewhere between like 3rd-8th I think,depending on who you ask,i just mean in terms of peak play, mechanical skill, decision making, individual talent,their overall ability to be good at the game,if we're talking JUST mechanical skill i think im easily top 5, probably even easily top 3,but there's more to winning than that,when i think about 1v1ing people like mini or joltz in tournament and trying to kill them,im not sure if i can do it,nah seriously,they're just hard to kill,shifu's job is to dive in 1v1,outplay,and then teammates follow up,but what if i lose the 1v1?,🤔,Anyone wanna pubg,?,@here,100%,im down right now,just chillini,chillin,also i was right,kar98 is like,the best gun in the game,it's SO godlike,ya, im gonna heat

LOL,that's so gay, didnt give me the win cus i dc'd,ya i only have wins in squad,0 in duo 0 in solo,i haven't,i hear it's insane tho,which is weird, cus in the squad games we win i always get like 5-9 kills,so you'd THINK i'd be fine in solo/duo,but nope,always just get shot from some guy i don't see and die in like 2 shots,well of course it's weak,but it's pre-silenced,that's insane enough by itself,it's probably still a 2 shot if you headshot the first shot,but ya i actually learned,even the m24 doesn't 1shot through level 3 helm,aka the airdrop only sniper,i don't even think the AWM 1 shot headshots,with the .500 magnum shots,but im not 100% on that,well anyway,i learned MANY things,very brain,neewha just held m2,and sprayed with the new sniper,and killed a guy,LOL,he has 2 snipers,a kar98 and the new sniper,ROFL,<@99157649139986432> scuffed jays,<@99157649139986432>,u wanna be our fourth,me neewha patrickstar,or eoekas,or anyone rly,o i didnt know u guys were playing,then play,while u wait,owo,eating tub of icecream,while watching pubg,pog,if someone drops out lmk guys,oreo cookiedough,something or other,generic good ice cream,we also have chocolate peanut butter and thin mint in the fridge,stacked PogChamp,weebs ¯\_(👁👄👁)_/¯,weebs ¯\_(👁👄👁)_/¯,<@105221541024772096>,ULU,<:pogCh:313335558967525377>,,FeelsSomethingMan,pretty sure,i just made the most useful post,i've ever made,in my entire lie?,life?,Reddit,some guy said he was having a lot of trouble improving,and he's a former ssbm player who quit because he got too frustrated,after 4 years of playing,and never improving,so now he's having the same problem with BR,i love the ssbm community, so i had to offer my help,makes me very sad to think someone played ssbm, tried their hardest, and lacked the understanding of how to meaningfully improve to such a large degree that they felt no choice but to quit,and he played for 4 years, not like a couple months,the game is brutal, but still,nah,if ur good at ssbm ur good at anything,game is harder than anything any human was meant to do,it's the only game that's ever injured my hands,literally if u have both the drive, the reaction speed, muscle memory, mindgames, and everything else it takes to be good at ssbm,every other game is a joke by comparison,u normally only need like,20% of the effort u need in ssbm,lol,im br god,after last tourney im prolly top 3 in world,and the 2 better players are both eu,with how my teammates played,pls no,im sure they'll play better next week, they always bounce back,someone,play,pubg,it's ok,i just watch hajime no ippo,for 30,000th time,ippo <:pogCh:313335558967525377>,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7XCROlZ9ao,it's so good,first comment,"i didn't read, but why would u reset cus there's too many champs and gc?",i reply with,"read the post, you fucking idiot?",wtf is reddit,<:datboi:269923546103414784>,verosk, wanna play?,also,i rock 200 fps in pubg,with my 4 year old PC,my pc is straight godlike,because my pc cost like,3400 dollars,or something insane,like 2-3 times as much as a normal pc,a normal "gaming" pc even,it'll last another 5 years before i have to replace anything,it's a monster pc,dual quadcore i7 6300k processor,Kreygasm,dual gtx 980ti,24 gigs of ram,computer's actually just like, stupid,it's got a hybrid cooling system, water cooling and 3 fans all over the PC,1200w power supply,which isn't enough btw, since my computer power surges all the time,might get another one,nikita,u pubg,fuck no,that game's gay,let's goooooooo,im going to,NIKITA'S KINGDOM,TM,ok,<@227161493227962370> how long,It's interesting to think that i'll never experience death,🤔,well,technically,none of you will experience death,in fact, nobody has experienced it,🤔,please dont get a deathadder,it's SO bad,http://www.finalmouse.com/shop.php,serious,very tempted to make a long post called "battlerite will die",and since it's me it'll get like 30000 responses,game that isn't out can't be dead,it's the mentality the devs and everyone else uses,they don't care about EA players cause f2p release is what matters,i mean, sure, that logic works,except the game hasn't improved at all in 6 months, and will be out of EA within another 6 months if what devs said is true,what do they think is going to happen? they've already wasted far too much time,the game is doomed,lol,if they still had a year to work on the game and made updates that were meaningful every 2 weeks, the game would have the slimmest chance in hell,instead we get a visual rework once per month with no new champs, skins still blow, gameplay is still rock paper scissors and stale, 0 social features, 0 ui updates, no ingame tournaments, no spectate, nothing,they've added NOTHING,in forever,it's literally like 1 legendary skin, 1 visual rework, and 1-2 extremely minor balance per months. That's what they're averaging right now.,If nothing changes,and we assume it continues at that rate,when game goes f2p, nothing will change,well then i'll say what everyone else has been saying,what ARE they working on,because they havent,DONE,ANYTHING,i've read every single dev blog 2-3 times,nothing is being worked on,there,has been nothing,that's grabbed my attention as like "oh, glad they're finally working on that. Good step in the right direction",absolutely nothing,u lack fundamental understanding,they've been working on "new player experience" for AT LEAST 2 months now.,again, if we assume they implement one decent MANDATORY feature per 2 months, we'll get a maximum of 2 more by the time the game comes out. And about 4-5 more visual reworks. Maybe one more BIG change that takes them half a year like the m1 update.,You think just that is enough to save this game?,You must be joking,it needs 10 TIMES that much work,there's almost nothing in the game that doesn't need a complete rework/overhaul,on top of that they need to fix balance, they need to add 10 more champions minimum, they need to add a new weekly brawl mode, they need to fix the ranked system, they need to fix literally EVERYTHING,i've never seen a game with so much shit wrong,yet devs that don't seem to know what to fix,it's unreal,then why isn't it being fixed,if it is being fixed, why is it being fixed so fucking slowly?,even if they have the right idea, it's irrelevant. The clock is ticking, the game will be out in 6 months mAX,MAX,absolute END,6 months,Do you understand that if f2p increases the size of the playerbase by 10 times, AND those players are retained, it's an enormous failure?,This game wants to be an esport,10,000 concurrent players?,i could make a game with 10,000 concurrent players without any idea or programming experience,please,nothing happened,zab sucked and i flamed the shit out of him,cus i was tired of him sucking,which is also what im about to do to SLS,no, i apologized cause i felt bad and zab was very clearly hurt by what seemed like me attacking him for no reason,i've never said or done anything i've regretted in my entire life,not once,lol,ya,how,much,time,then what's with their release date?,6 months max?,if planning and designing takes so much time that the most we're getting is a couple of small balance changes and a champion redesign per month, without them adding any other features besides ONE ongoing big thing in the background for 3-4 months (UI this time, m1 changes last time),Then what's with their plan to release by the end of the year?,it can't possibly be done,there's no way,lol,Like, i've played this game for almost a year at this point. I see the rate the developers are working on, and using the logical assumption that nothing will change and they won't suddenly start working 10 times as fast, we can assume what the state of the game will be when the game releases based on the current rate of releasing content now. And the reality is that we'll have 5 champion visual reworks, MAYBE 1 or 2 new champions, 1 or 2 new maps, a UI rework, a good new player experience, and that's it.,Still missing ingame tournaments, still missing spectate, still missing everything else they need,the game is absolutely 200% fucked,unless they release late 2019,imoshen that isn't it,they don't need to prioritize certain things better,They need to implement absolutely everything,It may sound harsh because they need to do so much in so little time,but they need to do,EVERYTHING,every single request every player has ever asked for that isn't straight retarded,should be in the game,they're working WAY too slow,this only raises more questions though as i've said 10 trillion times,If they've been working on UI design for 3 months or whatever, and we're getting a champ visual rework every 3 months (another art design thing),what,are,the,fucking,programmers,DOING,it's emphasis,we haven't heard anything that changes the programming of the game in months,there's only 6 months left,no ranked changes, no ladder changes, no new gamemodes, champs, anything like that that programmers and champ designers work on,where the fuck are they? what the fuck are they doing?,im actually,probably gonna dedicate the entirety of the day to making this post,it'll be minimum 30 paragraphs,nobody will read the entire thing,and ifc,idc*,klerny again,4-5 months per champ is amazingly slow, yes,but consider how much slower it is when the game comes out in another 4-5 months,it's SO fucked,right? it isn't like development is slow but the game is coming out in late 2019,it's coming out in 5 months,it's 100% dead,like, nigga i started one piece 5 months ago,on top of pro gaming, i finished the show,800 episodes,how are they SO slow,Oh yeah, doesn't that actually make it even funnier womack,katy parr posted on twitter recently,she's going for a month long vacation,in croatia,im not even kidding,LOL,done?,their work is NEVER done,or the game dies,lol,"sometimes you even have to down prioritize your own sanity" - sls dev in that youtube video,you think anyone feels sympathy for you?,of course i fucking don't,after such a pitiful performance,you dont deserve a fucking break,they aren't working to work hard for anything,lazy fucking swedes,i've never imagined that people could lack dedication for the only thing they care about, supposedly. "Battlerite is a passion project, we care more about it succeeding than we care about anything else" No you don't you lying fucks, you care about your own sanity, if you didn't care about your own sanity, you'd shut the fuck up and stop crying about it hoping people will empathize with you,shut the fuck up and work already,like holy shit sls,fucking crybabies,if it's your passion, make it happen regardless of the cost,if nothing else matters, have that mentality,it's like nobody at SLS has any drive and doesn't know what it means to dedicate your life to something,just fucking pathetic,if only my life was so easy as getting a paid month long vacation after 6 months of working my hardest,i've gamed 14-18 hours a day every day including weekends for 6 years,with the intention of being a pro,what fucking weak mentality,i dropped out of school,i got rid of my OWN FUTURE,to persue my goals,they have no idea what sacrifice or dedication actually is,it's fucking sad,no, u don't,because it's scary and hard,most people prefer a safe secure life where everything is a balance,i don't want that,i want to be a living god,i'll be a god once there's no chance anyone can face me,in any game,probably 6 or so more years off,if you think im getting close to stopping, you're wrong,i've only started working hard recently,to dedicate your life to something you care about no matter what it costs you or how hard it is, that's what a passion project is. Not this crying about working too hard and how the community's bullying you shit that SLS is on,they're actually so weak mentally idek what to say,im 21, btw.,turned 21 in april,Like idk what happened to people with the "get there or die trying" mentality,SLS is so scared of failure they're dooming themselves,you think im not xywok?,i play ssbm every day,i plan on going pro in both,probably not,i won't be ready yet,i don't play MS anymore,didn't have time,i play BR because im the king,king doesn't relinquish throne,have i? i've made thousands of dollars off BR already,more than i've made in any other game except LoL,oh ya maplestory was a waste of time,that was my SLS vacation,for a couple weeks,i'm not a god yet,life is about whatever you want it to be about,but don't say battlerite succeeding is your passion project and the most important thing to you if you can't even work on it nonstop,well, in my case it's a bit different,there's nobody at SLS as talented or scary as me,i don't have to give 100% to achieve my goals,i try as hard as i feel like trying and that's enough,ya,i've got a long way to go,the fact that people still exist near my level is offensive,once my play is perfect if people are still close to me it's a problem with the game,but my play is sloppy and bad right now,i mean, still top 3 in the world easily,but bad,idk womack,idek who u are,so,ya,im just a unique person,there's no person with the competitive drive or motivation i have,it's unhealthy to be as dedicated as i am,but i still don't consider myself dedicated enough,im still too lazy,my life should consist of eating, sleeping, and gaming,and nothing else.,Ever.,and with adderall i can sleep about half as much as i do now,im just too lazy,spend time shitposting on reddit and discord,play other games casually for fun,watch anime and youtube all the time,it's a sad lack of effort,i have time for the stuff im doing now once i'm a god,well, i think anime has been good for me to some degree,the characters in anime are the only people who are so over the top dedicated like me,it gives me a lot of motivation to work towards,i mean, anime characters are very one dimensional,they often don't change and have personal traits that don't ever change, so in particular if you find one who's dedicated to becoming the best, it's consumes their entire life and it's all they ever do, even once they've long surpassed the goals they originally set.,it's a good mentality to have,that no matter how well you do it's never enough,like the fact that we've lost 2 out of the last 23 tournaments is disgusting,should never happen,nah not really,one piece doesn't have characters like that,luffy's too carefree,he's just broken cause that IS the plot of onepiece,he's basically one punch man,lol,nah, i'm more referring to ippo,or sendo,or vorg,people who are willing to die for literally no reason,except to prove they're the best,and then even once they succeed, they don't feel fufilled at all,and feel the need to do even better,it's an endless cycle,pretty sure the coach says something along the lines of "The kid is chasing after something invisible, a path harder than obtaining any belt",obviously i don't box,but the mentality's the same,u literally kill urself,just to be perfect,it's worth,i can say it because it's relatable,the mentality of characters like that is the mentality i've had my entire life, even before i watched anime when i was like 15,nothing else matters except being the best,should sacrifice literally anything for that goal,ya,im nightmare fuel,there's nobody as dedicated as me because being so dedicated is insane,but that's exactly why it's good,there's no person on earth more dedicated than me because my mentality is such that it's impossible to be, even if they try their hardest constantly,same with the amount i practice,my goal was always to be the best via a brute force method,if you just try harder and play more than everyone else and you already have a good natural grasp of how to improve, you'll sit at the top by default,don't need to do anything special,most of the people who are the best in the world don't do anything special, they just have the same mentality as me and similar dedication,anyone can do it, most people just don't because it's unhealthy and insane,no, it's a conscious decision for me,within the first 2 hours of a game,i decide whether i'll be the best at it or not,if not, i normally don't keep playing it,and besides, if you simply play when you're enjoying it or when you feel like it, there'll be someone like me playing during those times, but ALSO when they dont want to and aren't enjoying it,that difference matters,wing, that's the mentality i used for my first 3-4 years trying,and then i suddenly realized,that isn't enough,i could get to the top 0.1%, within the top couple hundred players doing that,but never to the top of the world,to get to the top of the world, you need something nobody else has,if u just play when u want, you're the same as every other nerd who just likes gaming more than everything else,see, that's a great poin,ponit,...,point,there's actually nothing wrong with that mentality at all, IF you don't care about being the best in the world,if you just want to be top 0.1% so you can brag to your friends about how you coach people in league, that's just fine,if you feel satisfied with being good but not the best, then it's fine,it's about how much you care about being the best to ever live,Do you want to win, or do you want to be a legend that nobody will ever come close to?,i look at it that way as well, but in a more literal since. In a practical sense, playing 8 hours of league a day most days because you find the game fun and getting to diamond 1 won't net you anything. No fame, no fans, nobody will know who you are still and you won't make any money. But getting to the very top of the world will give you all of those things, and you're already probably over halfway there.,For me, if I'm going to play something, I'm going to be the best because that's the only way it's worth doing,just being a monster at the game isn't enough to feed yourself and pay bills with,nor is it enough for anyone to care,could that time be better spent elsewhere to get a larger benefit for less effort? IE: going to college and using that degree to make signficantly more money?,almost certainly,but then it comes down to how much you're willing to hate your own life, imo,i probably wouldn't make it through college because i'd have 0 interest or motivation both in college and in what comes after,i only exist for the purpose of being a pro gamer,i'd rather be dead,than work a 9-5,eh?,everyone in my life has called me failure. The words of other people who haven't walked in my shoes mean nothing to me.,If I try as hard as I can and I fail, I'll accept it.,Objectively, I've set myself back 4 years already. I still don't drive and didn't graduate school. I've never worked a job and i'm 21.,I've already gone well beyond the point most people would give up at,or be forced to give up at, via life making them,haven't driven in 2 months hansa,lol,haven't had time,i've firmly believed in my gaming ability my entire life. I genuinely believe in my heart that i'm the most talented gamer naturally to ever live. I need to work hard enough to bring all of that potential out.,If I can't do it, it just means I was wrong.,and i'll accept failure at that point,if i give everything i have and it isn't enough, there's no choice but to give up, right?,my mentality has always been natural talent + time invested + effort invested = outcome,if i invest the MAX amount of time/effort,and don't sit at the top,then it means i wasn't talented enough,i'll quit before that point.,and that's it womack, as I said this is something I've dedicated my life to.,I've never considered the possibility of failure,I have no idea what i'll do.,Common sense says you should have a backup plan, but forming one takes time and effort I could be using to become a pro. So I figured i'd expend 100% of my effort on that and if it didn't work, I'd be fucked.,I came to that conclusion when i was 15.,oh, i'm simply saying,if i fail, that's it,there is no backup plan,indeed,im not perfect,that's why i still have a lot of work to do,to be fair, i have more hours in BR than anyone else,im pretty sure,and that's with what i consider pretty exceptional laziness,regular 5-10 day breaks without playing at all outside tournament,if i gave 100% into BR,it wouldn't even be close,nyy, that's called being an adult,mentally, i haven't changed since i dropped out at all,i have no interest in growing up or being an adult,it's not the life i want to live,indeed,im so confident in my success, that i've prepared absolutely nothing for my failure,it's still a possibility, in fact it's probably more likely than me succeeding,but i don't care,just gonna prove odds wrong,lol,when shifu got gutted,i was worried,i don't really care about battlerite,battlerite is just the stepping stone through which i'll achieve my goals,the game itself is whatever,imagine how i feel nyy,LOL,losing a single tournament is like,death,fortunately, averse is in the same position,we're both living off our BR tourney winnings,so we won't lose probably,i don't pay anything,i contribute nothing to society,joltz we had very meaningful discussion,but ya womack, most people who hear my life story and plan pretty much come up with "holy shit dude, that's really stupid and sad and you're an idiot",but that's ok,it's just how i want to live my life,objectively, nobody could make a dumber decision than throwing their future away with no backup plan,to play video games,they think i can do it,but also simultaniously can't support me forever,so they're pretty torn,oh, back in highschool i was a real prick. I didn't care about anyone or anything,nothing they said or did had any impact on me,when i told my dad i was dropping out to be a pro gamer, he literally broke 3 of my ribs,and then i dropped out anyway,cus i didn't care,well my dad is like,450 pounds,and i was like,110 at the time,i got one punch man'd,well, im talking about my biological father,the guy i call my "dad" is my stepdad,he raised me since i was like 2,dude ditched my mom after he got her pregnant,cus he already had a wife,and 6 kids,im the YUNGEST,well,he disowned me after i dropped out anyway,cause i told him god wasn't real,and he was PISSED,i was like "dude im pretty sure if you think there's a man in the sky that created everything ur a retard",and we had like a 3 hour convo about it,and i was like "ya no ur stupid",so he was pissed,he's like, super catholic,gone to church every sunday morning for like,30 years,at least,way less,the number of athiests has gone up as education and intelligence in general has gone up,what a strange coincidence.,<:thunking:269957648395403274>,well anyway, u've probably gather that im too stubborn to listen to anyone or anything,just from like talking to me,but i've been that way my entire life with everyone,what i say is how it is,if i decide something, the chance of changing my mind is 0%,even with really sound logic and reasoning,im just too stubborn,well,a guy can dream,😛,u aren't normally supposed to go this hard after ur dreams tho,¯\_(ツ)_/¯,it's because people live in fear of reality,i fucked up my teeth as a kid by drinking 12 cans of soda a day,all of my teeth are fake now, it cost my mother 40,000 dollars,if my mom weren't there,what would i do,you know?,that's the kind of thing that makes people abandon their dreams,thoughts about reality, security, and the fact that sometimes shit just happens,that you don't see coming,and you need some way to deal with it,or you're fucked,but i choose the actual retard of mentality of,"hope nothing bad happens then","cause i'm fucked",my teeth were ruined by age 16 or 17,i don't really remember,i've been to the dentist probably 100 times,for it,and it's about 60% fixed,maybe like 70%,bad news is, the fake teeth have to be replaced every 15-20 years,so uh,rip 120,000 dollars,over the course of my life,nyy,this program looks sick,gonna spend the ENTIRE day,making anime gifs,brb,ROFL,WTF,HE'S DONE IT,o,can't post gif i took,cus it's TOO POWERFUL,for discord,rip,[–]kaia112 1 point an hour ago 
I do feel its fine, i'm also in that position with a 47% winrate and i know for a fact i'm as good/ better than most people in the Diamond league so what's the problem, wr doesn't mean shit, lots of circumstances, like for example i only play support and 2 of my top 3 are under 50% winrate but if i play with my main there is a 80% chance i am going to win, and even if i do lose know that i kept up well.,new copypasta boys,he's done it,u need to give a little more context,put like "im champion with 47% winrate" instead,and boom,done,god,my degen family,has been screaming at eachother,for AT LEAST 6 hours,can't even join discord or stream or do anything,cus they're so loud,zzzzzzz,loud,someone wanna reg with me for this 2v2 battlerite brawlers tourney?,for like no reason?,it's an EU tourney,doesn't seem like ninjas is around,ok hansa,tourney's in like a half hour,register on the esports wall site,<@250636384774127616>,i have to invite you to team,i just invite u,once u reg,and u accept somewhere,probably in "edit teams" or something,i sent invitation,asked ninjas if he wanted to enter,"i think im gonna play LoL instead",ninjas hasn't practiced in 2 weeks,neither have me or averse,wonder if we'll lose on tuesday,it was super close,but more importantly, i carried insanely hard,my play isn't normally that good,and it was SO close,he was diamond 3 when he quit iirc,i was diamond 1,averse challenger,him and averse play like every day now together,trying to get back into it,for whatever reason,if i had money lying around i'd buy an account and bop them for fun,but eh,my best friend jeff started playing LoL again recently too,i didn't lose my old account,i was permabanned 18 times,i was way more toxic than valien ever was,lol,or tyler1,or any of those non-toxic shit players,it's way worse to get shit talked by someone as good as me,not really,but it was fun,so i dont regret anything,life's about enjoying fun,worrying about consequences is lame,should just always do whatever you want to do without thinking at all,<:pogCh:313335558967525377>,literally any time valien messages me,i instantly block him without responding,it's pretty surprising he even still bothers,the guy is dedicated,<:pogCh:313335558967525377>,hansa definitely not as good as ninjas,will bet life savings on it,actually,i'll bet the LIVES of my family and everyone i hold dear,i'll bet,literally anything,ya,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6YCxypnBxc,ESKETITTTTTTTT,ya,hansa SUCKS,i baited 99.9% of counters,randoms,actual randoms,hansa just hit every counter and instant died,it was great,i beat his average score by 200 when he was sirius,top LUL,150 ping,https://youtu.be/mPwf10pKRk8,actually addicted to this song,it's so good,this,song,man,it's very generic, but my music tastes swing really heavily from day to day,and i've been super into this kind of post-alternative pop punk shit lately,it's a fucking yanger,im trying to think of the band they remind me of,this was like my highschool music,except i never left highschool in my mind,so,im jamming,skateboarding <:pogCh:313335558967525377>,i sucked at skateboarding,i used to longboard everywhere tho,NA LUL,L O N G,what stopped me from skateboarding was a lack of interest,i always figured anyone who skateboarded or played guitar did it to impress chicks and for no other reason,i realize now that i was actually like 10,000% correct,so just for the sake of being stubborn i was like "im gonna play drums","or do something chicks don't care about",still have same mentality,if u have to do something special to impress women, ur the worst,just have an impressive existence,2003?,what're you, 40?,LUL,what 13 year old looks like that,man, it's crazy to me to imagine it's only been 5 years since highschool,i'm so thankful that my reactions won't slow down for another 7 years or so,should be plenty of time to accomplish everything i want to do,honestly i'll probably be competitive well into my 30's,i think 35 ish is around where i'll stop,then i'll do what everyone does during their middle age,become a pro poker player,legend,of,arakune,it's a good plan,i've never doubted my own ability in anything, so plans like that aren't particularly risky or unviable,i've been good at poker as long as  i can remember,i always win money,and i've been playing on and off for like 6 years,honestly i've been super bored for the last 2 weeks,im gonna play some poker,it's time to gamble,it's been too long,of course,i don't lose,😄,rng,game,"Luck and skill are not mutually exclusive.

Oh yes. They are absolutely right and have been right the entire time. People need to stop whiteknighting games or studios for things they enjoy. Criticism is so essential and so it's backwards for people to only defend them if they want a better product. This is the case for BLC before Battlerite. If there's a third game I won't be supporting until it's fully released and successful because all these years spent between both games has proven that they aren't invested or good enough to be any better than we've seen.
There's nothing hidden behind closed doors that's so unbelievably good that Battlerite is going to explode and be big for years to come. You'd be foolish to think otherwise. And when they do finally release and push out some updates and people flock to say "See, told you so, they've been preparing for this all along!", no, just no. It will die down and the game will eventually die again as well. This is their nature and this is all this studio will ever be.,reddit understands,the fear is in SLS's heart,T O X I C P E S S I M I S T I C W A R R I O R S,F L A M E S L S,if we flame them,there's a 0.001% chance they realize people see through their facade, and it actually forces them to fix the game. Despite not showing any signs of wanting to or being capable of doing it,but honestly, we just need to vent cus they're such retards,F L A M E,ya,there's an absolute 0% chance the game will be saved,im certain at this point,battlerite WILL die,no, it's not 100% to be good,it's 100% doomed,the only possible outcome at this horribly late stage of SLS having fucked up,is if they hire 10 more ACTUAL COMPETENT staff,pay themselves less,AND delay release to late 2018,and learn how to communicate with community feedback to improve the game,they fail in every possible regard,communication, execution, timeliness, prioritization, everything,there's nothing they're doing right,even if they fix 1 or 2 huge problems they have, the others remain and will plague the game's success and longterm life,it's 100,000% FUCKED,i guarantee u,you couldn't manage a product any WORSE,with the amount of resources they have,a fucking donkey could hire some more competent employees, a couple community managers, and actually use the vast time, money, and data/feedback they have available to both add new content and improve the game in productive objective ways,they're actually so stupid,it's unfathomable,the worst part is it doesn't seem like a cash grab, they really seem to want battlerite to succeed,the unfortunate sad reality is, they just suck,they suck at communication, they suck at programming, they suck at consistency, they suck at following through with their promises, they suck at coming up with new original content to release, they suck at working long hours (never seen a company working on a "passion project" cry SO much about how hard they work and their mentally drained state, whilst also simultaniously accomplishing less than every other developer) They take too long to do everything, from visual overhauls to balance changes to any form of new content be it skins or maps or champions,everything about SLS is so fucking bad,i can't actually imagine how they got this far,how did they even create battlerite,with this level of actual incompetency,im legit serious,i don't get how they made such a good base game with the people they seem to have staffed there,they don't seem capable,I guess they've been working on it for 6 years?,If we look at it this way, it actually makes sense that battlerite would be the product of SLS working for about 6 years before releasing alpha,it's about the rate of improvement currently, matches up.,in other words,the game needs another 3-6 years,before it releases,lol,or they need to double their staff,cause if the starting point > 4-6 years in their spare time after blc's success as a passion project > battlerite alpha,they were slow as fuck then too,and sucked at implementing features,it's like the guy said,nothing like that exists to save the game,because SLS are either uninterested, or straight up incapable,based on everything SLS says and does, it's safe to assume they honestly aren't sandbagging and care about the game. I really still believe that,now my opinion has gone from "sls are money hungry lazy fucks" to "sls actually just isn't good enough at their job to make battlerite the game it could be",that's the honest truth, i think,like,until they prove they can listen to community feedback, implement new content more than once every 2-3 months, can balance patch more accurately, quickly, etc. and can program features people want and need in the game (hitbox adjustments, ability bug fixes, new UI, tourney system, etc) in less than 1-2 months,we can't expect them to,we can only expect what we've already seen AT BEST,they aren't suddenly gonna become 3 times as efficient as they've been this whole time,because they've actually been trying this whole time,they just,suck,lol,i almost feel bad for them in a way,but i feel worse for myself,what a waste of my time,they undertook trying to create the next esport,with a concept that could do it,and they THEMSELVES,couldn't do it,battlerite could've been the next big esport,i saw the potential in the game when i played it,i still do, honestly,but the devs will never do what needs to be done for it to succeed,the game is dead before release,lol,well,league is why i was so good at BR to begin with,even at the very start i was 80% winrate,first day,obviously gaming skills carry over to some degree,a lot of it comes down to experience and the number of games you've been competitive at,oh ya,i was 80% winrate without ex abilities,but everyone was a lot worse back then,i was also on pre-rework pre-buff varesh,with my friend who played croak,swag,ULU,look certainly in the last 9 months, i'd go as far as to say SLS has improved battlerite substantially,there's more content, better gameplay, and lots of little fixes and reworks that have made the game more interesting,but with 3-6 months until release and the current pace, this game functionally is ABOUT what we should expect f2p to be,and that just isn't good enough,they need to change a lot,a LOT more,probably more than they've done over the entirety of the last 9 months,in order for it to be the game they want it to be,and we want it to be,they don't have the time, skills, or resources to do it,apparently,so we're fucked,i did too 4 months ago,here i am,4 months later,somehow becoming LESS impressed with every patch and blog post,than i was with the last,how can they just continually get worse?,during the time of the big m1 change, i thought things were really looking up and they were listening to community feedback and they were implementing big shifting important good changes in a relatively timely manner,and then after that, boom, nothing since,literally nothing since then,they did what they needed to do with ONE of the like, 10 or so features that need to be in the game/dramatically changed/fixed,for this game to be 10/10 esport potential endless replay value game of the year,shit,and didn't do ANY of the other ones,probably because they can't,global chats, social system, tournies, UI, more characters (at least 5) new maps (at least 2. And I don't mean one that's day/night. I mean 2 of each.),all of these things,need looking at,and if sls was on a good pace, they'd take roughly a month each to complete,MAYBE 1 1/2-2 months each,but their rate is wayyyyyyy below that,it's SO slow,it's unreal,his rites got 100% reworked,which counts,since it was the same as shifu,3 months roughly per rework, 2-4 months average per champion release, 2-3 months average per map release, 3-4 months average per big change (m1 change, giant tourney announcements/esports stuff/dev blogs, and now UI 2.0),The rate is simply TOO SLOW,if you cut all those times in half,you still wouldn't release by the end of 2017,do they not understand this pace simply isn't good enough,even if they somehow make no mistakes and everything's implemented perfectly first try,which it won't be,cause that isn't how that works,lol,i mean look at their fourth iteration of the ranked system,case in point,sometimes it takes multiple tries to get it right,they don't have time just to implement it at all and try it out for a while,let alone make it perfect,ya but honestly speaking,the reworks are the least important thing,nobody cares about balance anymore, including me, a top player of the game period,give me some god damn,mother,fucking,CONTENT,new champ, new map, new features that are flashy and cool and different,just,SOMETHING NEW,it's been 4 months since i've seen ANYTHING NEW AT ALL,look, the new map is sweet,but it's all they've given us,one map with a nighttime lighting in whatever programming software they're using rearranging some of the walls (pretty sure the map itself is borderline identical, same for all day/night maps),per 4 months,is just not enough content,if they added a 2 champs, 2 maps, and some other juicy features on top like ingame social systems or UI? i think that's a good pace for a relatively small studio,doing a 1/3rd of that or less doesn't cut it,it just doesn't,there's no excuse,lol,see this is what i mean,that stupid naive mentality is exactly why people think the game isn't dead,why the fuck would they release 2 champs at once,storing them up,when people have been bitching about wanting a new champ for 4 months at LEAST,and the last champ substantially increased the size of the playerbase for a large amount of time,on top of that, they only EVER released 2 champs at once a single time, and it was at the very beginning when their pace was MUCH better than it is now,they aren't even working at half that speed anymore,how the fuck do u think they have 2 champs stored up they're saving,ur actually NUTS,if you think that,snoobl,like i said,not enough,F2P goal:
UI 2.0
New Tutorial that covers all basics (EX, energy, health...)
Rework all champions
5 new champions 
2 new maps
Ingame Global Chat system
Ingame Tournament system
Ingame Leaderboards
Revamped Matchmaking system,that's what it SHOULD say,fucking sls,but if that was their goal,we'd get the game at the 2nd of 2032,after the heat death of the universe,but all of those things make a large difference,that actually matters,whether or not they can implement it isn't the question, if it's required, you implement it.,They want the game to esport, to be as good and as successful as it can possibly be,why are they setting the bar so low?,it's not like i expect them to do all the things i listed, that's a lot of shit,but i expect them to do ONE OR TWO OF THEM,not like, actually 0,you know? what i listed is an ideal game made by an ideal company working under the best circumstances. SLS isn't even a compromise though, they just fail in every respect,tbh im getting sick of talking about this,so im done talking about it,but if u think battlerite will be saved, ur extremely naive,i gave up on the game forever ago, after wasting almost a year of my life on it,time that's extremely limited btw, since i have to become a pro gamer before i inevitably get kicked out of my house,and im already 21,even with my situation, i know battlerite is fucked,ur retarded if you think anything else,i now understand what people meant when they said,"have a backup plan in life, sometimes shit just happens and there's nothing you can do, and you have to account for and prepare for those situations",the situation is as such, I try to become a pro gamer in a game that I see as a new potential esport that I know can be successful, not only did i not have horrible taste in the game since battlerite actually could've made it for sure, i also somehow succeed in my goal of being on the best team in the world in the game and proceed to make more money than anyone else,despite everything going right and me making every right choice, i get FUCKED for no reason,by SLS's inability to improve their own game,that's "shit happens",SLS killing their own game with a lack of competency has now fucked me out of my dream of being a pro gamer,again,despite me doing nothing wrong,fuck u SLS,too unrealistic,no matter how good you are, the ocean is simply too vast,there's no way to get noticed,i crushed tons of top pro players in LoL and i was never even acknowledged for a sponsorship or team pickup or anything of the like,xaynox,u suck and ur entire family sucks,choke on a fat cock retard,my pro dream is already dead,because sls doesn't know how to make video games,they only know how to go on vacation,V I V A L A M E X I C O,well,maybe u dont start climbing the ladder from the top,but i do in pretty much every game,we're just different,nah i like,pretty much start at the top,lol,i went from super unknown in BR to beating NA's at the time best 2v2 team in about 2 weeks,it's a long time for me,and a lot of effort for me,nah,it was the same as it is now,other players have only improved cause of us,well no,getting to the top of NA is impossible,an inhuman feat,because im there,but you can get 2nd or 3rd pretty easily,hides from reality?,i've lost 2 tournaments in the last 23 weeks,math is reality,well,im the best team on earth,and the best player on earth,so, yes we do?,where'd you hear that from?,you go weeks without practicing, play lazily, and the enemy team plays their best,dropping games or even a tournament is irrelevant,we lost our first tourney in 8 weeks,and the VERY NEXT DAY,played the same team and beat them 10-0,you just underestimate,that's all,there won't be LAN,this game will die long before it,oh?,how much are they paying me to go,lol?,we don't even play,nobody on onslaught has touched the game in 2 weeks,at least,it's worth noting,every team except us,plays AND scrims every single day now,we're just unbeatable,we dont have to play the game to win,the skill gap is insurmountable,if they practice for weeks on end and we don't play for weeks on end, there's a slim chance they can beat us once,but all that does is force us to practice,and then it's over again,nah, go ahead and ask,neewha's team, unsung, deadly insplosion,they scrim constantly,even a lot of the worse teams scrim,everyone wants to beat us,but it can't be done,it's a waste of effort,u don't get it,the game is only worth playing if there's a proportional reward,the game is going to die,so staying at the top doesn't matter anymore,i don't care whether we lose or not.,Even so, we won't lose.,because we're just better,we don't have to play the game, or even care about winning to win,that's the world we live in,dunno,like 1000 or so,it's enough to be worth doing,sponsorship's irrelevant,they take nothing,u must be joking,we're the best team on earth,we got contacted by fnatic,you think we'd take any contract where we didn't take 110% profit,?,because,they said they're waiting for f2p,but, like us, they'll be disappointed when the time comes,the game will die before it even hits f2p,it's pointless to try to force SLS to do something they can't do,it's pointless to play an unfun uninteresting game,for no reason,the reason i've played for the last 1000 hours is the feeling of needing to win for when the game was esports,but the esports won't happen,so it doesn't matter anymore,i probably won't practice again,money is the dream fool,dreams don't pay bills,lol,if there's no money in the game, it's a waste of time and ultimately has to stop,same reason i quit a ton of other games i was amazing at,of course not,i've always been confident in my ability to win to the point of near insanity,just on principle alone i have no backup plan or plan b for if i fail,there is no failure,like nothing,the money's all chump change,it's fine, because we were expecting more money as the game got bigger,but the game won't get bigger,sooooooooo,what is there to understand,well, that's way more than i earn,if you're wondering how i pay bills, i don't,what about em,ya,what of it,no,i don't pay,a single cent,for anything,in life,?,i have to make money playing BR to justify playing games,you think my parents would let me play video games all day with the dream of being a pro if i wasn't making money?,are you nuts?,ya,it's not even as much as part time work earns you,but im too lazy to ever work,fuck that,cus im too lazy to do anything,sls paying themselves to playtest,15$/h minimum,who cares,sweden isn't america,basically,my family wants me if i'm going to be a pro gamer to be making enough monthly that i can support myself,honestly, pretty fair ask,but there's nothing i can do about battlerite's dying scene and the developer's lack of brains,i can't magically make more money appear,i win literally everything,lol,winghaven makes some guy do his job for him, pays him 80%, cuts 20% off the top doing literally nothing,he's the world's smartest man,sit in the office listening to kept on repeat,kept is godlike,well, i might want to fast forward my mid-lategame life plan to now,so i can use the finances to support gaming,that is being a pro poker player,way more money in it,but poker's so hard,i ended to play a videogame with a friend,i made 1 dollar,worth it,verosk, u gotta jump on the bandwagon early,idc about a good living,i just care about enough,ya,but mid tier lol teams don't win 98% of tournament,nobody was expecting the 8th best team in battlerite to make money,but the best team in the literal world,could BARELY survive,that was the hope,but they can't even accomplish that,maybe i'll go back to rocket league,i did used to be an actual god of rocket league,like THE best,what do u man verosk,planning for the future is something u do if ur planning to fail,literally never plan,u just do shit,and whatever happens happens,i can confirm,i make less than like,half minimum wage,off BR,it's mad gay,just give me more tournaments,wing,weren't u on like a sicknast homeless journey,that looked pretty sweet,wing is literally,what i will be,some day,and i love it,literal failure homeless shot out IDIOT with no future, but he loves every second of it,ur my inspiration wing,i just wanna have big dreams,fail them,and go,"fuck",my god,he's done it,he's the world's,greatest,the essence of the phrase "shit happens" is that regardless of what you do, sometimes you get fucked in the face by the world, for legit no reason,i don't need to "give up" my dream,because sls has killed it,before i do anything,my house is honestly,just a neverending carnival,everyone's SO nuts,it's great,pretty sure nobody in my area has an IQ about like 2 digits,no dude, i actually like,am so lazy,i'd rather sit through getting like domestic abused,than go get a job and live on my own,im a level of lazy beyond human comprehension,will do ANYTHING to sit around and do nothing,it's godlike,will literally play video games 16 hours a day and hate them,to justify playing them,because working 4 hours a day,is too much work,just game 16 hours a day,instead,very good logic,why would i get a part time job,when i could just,spend LITERALLY EVERY MOMENT OF MY LIFE,playing video games,and never doing anything else,even when i dont want to,<:pogCh:313335558967525377>,sick of what company,oh sls?,nah they're just retarded,it's whatever,o,i got bored of the game long ago,games aren't about fun,or winning,they're about money,it's not fun to get money,it's required,to continue existing without a job,o,my dream is so dumb nobody could ever accomplish it,but im still gonna try to do it anyway,my only goal in life, and this has been since i was like 14 or so,is simply to be known globally as the best gamer to ever live,the internet, technology, and as a result gaming will only become larger and larger and more and more widespread in the coming 10, 20, however many years,i want to be known as a living legend,literally forever,moment 37 is within the realm of my gaming potential,for sure,for me, it's never been a question of whether i AM a legendary gaming figure,i'm actually the most talented to ever live,i just need to accomplish things that will allow me to prove it to people,it's not enough to be the best in my own head,gotta prove it to the world,,NA plant on head,<:LUL:269941798107873286>,picture is called,"arakune LUL",<:LUL:269941798107873286>,rt,ty,i mow the lawn myself tyvm,did it today actually,it SUCKEDDDDDD,,idk where u get this number form,from,with the 20,000 dollar series thing,i make like,1k per month right now,for 2 months only,normally it's approx 260 dollars,per month,prl = only weekly tourney,1st for prl = 210 dollars,210/3 = 70,70/4 = 280,NA math,280 per month,if we win every tourney,which, we normally do,ya,1k per month during this series,but that's not an even remotely permanent amount,it's a 10 week 20k series,first off, we probably won't win all 10 weeks,cus we dont give a fuck about winning,it won't get higher,u fuck,there's no TOURNIES,cus there's no PLAYERS,cus there's no GAME,ur,2,down,syndrome,everyone in here can vouch for how long i defended SLS,they're indefensible,using past experience and MATH,you can't defend them,ya esports earnings is way off,i made a ton of money in 2016,from boosting/coaching in LoL,then i spent 10,000 dollars,in literally 2 months,swag,ya,that's what im saying,idek where the 400 they think i won came from,i was winning tournies in lots of games,rocket league, lethal league,ssbm locals,but idk where those figures come from,i literally,would rather be lit on fire,than do anything,sitting around all day VERY fun,no like,not at all,i'll be like,"man this job sucks","shit suuuuuuuucks",and it'll be proven that i was right,worth,ya say,working is for gays,im not bout it,like what logic is it,that u think,when im forced to work and live on my own,and hate it,that i'll be proven wrong in my lazy mentality,where i dont wanna work,u think i'll find satisfaction or joy out of my fuckin office depot job or grocery store  or whatever,definitely not,and the benefits of it, the extra money and freedom, i only care about for the sake of security,i have no interest in using those things for any purpose,nowhere to go, nothing i want to do, nothing i want to buy,the ability to do more stupid shit on a whim would be nice, but eh,it's not that big of a deal,i can do what i enjoy regardless,u dont seem to get it,the reason i exist in my current state is because it's the only time i can,even if im recognized as a gaming god it won't sustain me financially forever,at some point, eventually, i'll have to become a normal working member of society,99.9% of people do,i'm just putting it off as long as possible,because i dont feel like doing it,obviously im gonna abuse the system,people who have pride and honor for that kind of thing are stupid,the purpose of the system is for those who need it,IE: lazy idiot fucks,see,a girlfriend's too much work too,i prioritize whatever route in life requires the least work,i dont wanna do nuthin,for nobody,ever,each and every person can suck a cock,if they ever want me to do anything,"when ready",last 3 dev blogs (literally, check them) have said "we dont really have a lot to show, but it's on the way, we'll let you know when it's ready",they did THE riot games,"soonTM",<@141175772588146688> im around for pubg,zab had it coming,honestly, so do you,you fat fuck,zab made the mistake of attempting to exist poorly,it wasn't acceptable,if u can accept such a poor existence, it's ur problem,im the human embodiment of anger,i don't feel sadness,cus it's for the weak,anger is for the strong,weak people get sad about their problems,strong people get fucking PISSED,that's impossible,im american and you aren't,you're*,and no, i didn't,depression's for the weak too,caring about people other than yourself is a waste of both time and effort,america's the best country because i'm in it,not for any other reason,well,technically, almost everything is a waste of time and effort,doing nothing all the time is the optimal scenario,eh?,im here cause i want to be here,there's no reason to leave,some people feel some sense of guilt or whatever,but i dont really do that stuff,i would thrive in literally any situation,it's the type of person i am,i'd be chilling in like a saudi war camp,idgaf,im not the kind of guy who gives a shit about anything,including the situation surrounding me,i pretty much only care about chicks and gaming,cause there's nothing else worth giving a shit about,cus they're the only thing worth caring about,doesn't mean im gonna expend any effort,chicks are nice to look at,but they serve no purpose beyond that really,cause anything else would require effort,and i dont do the whole "trying" thing,what about em,my mom's a nice lady,i'd be pretty sad if she died,that's about it,i told you,im always serious,objectively speaking, im a genius,my mentality is stupid, and that's fine,naw,i'm impossible to shut down,can't be done,you don't have to cry,3 days later,because i raged at you in a video game,maylon brought it up, actually,being a degen is swag,being a normal functioning member of society is,so,gay,real talk rifle,if i was in ur shoes,i would've ended it all already,how can u fuck ur situation so badly,you've literally destroyed ur entire life,sick,eh,i prefer having infinite freedom,nah,just like,not ever committing myself to anyone or anything,so i can do whatever i want,with no regrets,always,video games are something i enjoy a lot,more than anything else probably,so i dont mind committing myself to them,but i could drop them at any time and not really care,oh, well that's where we're different i guess,im not interested in having kids,ever,is that what my mentality will be like when im 30?,somehow, i doubt it,maybe people just get so bored of their own lives they want a kid,but that's why i plan on living a life where im constantly interested,ya, womack,i've said that every single day,for literally 10 years,it's sick,growing up is EXTREMELY gay,being an adult is EXTREMELY gay,never plan on doing it,ever,I never understood that this magical change was supposed to occur sometime between age 17 and 21 or so, where you want to be independant and an adult and have all your own responsibilities,from my perspective, time has just passed,nothing's changed at all,and won't ever,i'd describe rifle as the textbook definition of an adult,a man who lives with his girlfriend he hates out of a sense of obligation and for the sake of someone other than himself, namely his kid, sacrificing most things he enjoys and an enormous chunk of his very life to bring home bread so his family can survive,what a waste of time,lol,i mean really,does that sound like a life anyone would actually want to live?,i can't believe that it is,someone would WANT to do what rifletown is doing?,it actually blows my mind,how can you give up so much for someone,im far too selfish to give up anything for anyone,lol,fizzi, that's not true,i can be empathetic towards things that make sense to me,well, it's a huge waste of time,but once you have the baby you have no choice at all.,That's why you don't have the baby,lol,why would i care?,i told you,i don't care about the situation surrounding me,at all,so?,life's an endless series of dicerolls,i continue to get lucky over and over and over again,because im 21 and have yet to lift a finger for anyone or do anything,oh womack, that's just practically speaking,they've been threatening to throw me out for years,but i don't care, i run things here,it doesn't make any difference,well nah rifle,if you're forced to pay child support, you mightaswell,im sure having a kid is really enjoyable,mightaswell reap the benefits,if you're getting fucked anyway,like it doesn't make sense to have the kid and then not exist,if i had a kid, i'd stick with the kid,but i wouldn't have the kid to begin with,lol,too much work,shut up you 4'6 fuck,i'll put your dick in the dirt,like i said,no use crying days later over me insulting you over something that was your fault,didn't realize you were so hurt,i even apologized when i was in the right,stop crying already,i'm a man of principles,if i see you, i'll say it to your face,100%,i mean, sure rifle,i dont rly care tho,i told you i wouldn't leave a kid,i'm not heartless,just don't have the kid,LOL,oh no,i just don't like people thinking im a horrible human being,it's more about image than anything else,my priorities in life are just strange to many people,ya, zab's always been one of my favorite people in the discord,didn't think he'd cry so hard,i've threatened people over less,and i've fought people over less,im too prideful to ever let anything go,clearly, you're the same,since you're still on this,i respect it,but in a way, you've gotta fuck off,maylon brought it up,you daft cunt,scroll up,the fuck u mean u dont care,i was responding to this fat fuck,<:pogCh:313335558967525377>,right?,lol,maylon,that's a great mentality,you're on your way to greatness,fuck you you 400 pound sack of sweat and skin,you aren't even a person,you're a human fuckin sandbag,maylon's face weighs more than my entire body,o,lame patch notes,they nerfed shifu,zzzz,nah,shifu isn't ranged,thus he doesn't deserve a nerf,i have enough talent to never work a day in my life if i don't want to,it's just a matter of whether i'm willing to expend 100% effort,spoiler: im not,cause that shit's mad gay,why,nobody reads anyway,nah,i havent read a book since school,dude,that's a SICK way to die,eh,pretty much any way to die is fine,and dying at any time is fine,living is overrated,prolly not,but only on my non-gay principles,no ur def gay,anything that sounds gay is gay,yeah right,zab wouldn't get close,don't think i've ever felt less threatened by anyone,u aren't gonna say anything,why,oh,rip,ya,i had a good time earlier,insulting every player in the game except me,they were all champion,ya ik how it goes eoekas,i was 98% winrate now im down to 88%,these people are ridiculous,lol,im almost not at #1 global winrate anymore,cause of these winstreak fucks,ya,it's my smurf,|SHIFU|,man,what is this,im just afk on battlerite,actually afk,tab into the game,and i have like 10 messages,asking for tips and 1v1s and shit,am i famous now?,zzzzz,i thought only averse got this shit,maylon and zab just never stop 69ing,dicks in eachother's mouths,at all time,that they're fuckin fags,maylon instigates, i respond and zab VALIANTLY defends him,fuck off,fuckin fags,it doesn't matter what you agree on,nothing you say or do matters,im gonna be shitfaced the ENTIRE lan,and the shit talk will be at 300%,i promise u that,you'll get something nobody has ever wanted,my actual real thoughts,on you people,lol,legacy?,the entire purpose of my life is to create my own legacy,im not weak enough to need a kid to carry on my name,my name will go on forever,people who live vicariously through their children are those too weak to accomplish what they set out to do themselves,and need someone else to do it for them,in a way, they're far lazier than i am,could u imagine being a parent and making your kid play soccer at the age of 6 or whatever,because you never went pro in soccer?,that kind of shit disgusts me,don't force someone else to live your life,ur kid should do whatever they want,and never be told what to do by anyone else,that's how my life is,lol,people who answer to authority are missing out on so much of life,i mean,i've got PRETTY good genetics,good looking af,i mean, im italian,i automatically beat like 95% of the population,italians are sooooooo good looking,thank god,tell u one thing,if i ever have a kid, it's gonna be with an italian chick,not fucking up my GODLIKE genetics,that's cus i broke it in highschool,a bunch of times actually,i used to get in fights on like a weekly basis,was so much fun,i miss highschool,zzz,what kind of question is that,im 21,and an egotistical god,no,lol,nobody's a virgin past age 16,unless u fucked up horribly,i've never even had any interest in women whatsoever, they actually came to me in HS for the most part,verosk, that's a weak mentality,words don't offend people,unless ur super weak,<@121630407782432769> in my hotel room at some con,like 2012 or so,my ex,started cus i told her i was tryna get it,and she was like,"ok",and that was it,it actually wasn't that complex,u just sort of,hit up the girl,and go,"hello",and then they get naked and u win,real talk, idk what average IQ is,but mine's really high,which is funny, considering how dumb my mentality is,actually makes no sense,oh, really?,huh, weird system,well,mine's 142, regardless,apparently i was tested when i was really young,i don't remember it, my mom said i was 7 or 8 when they tested my IQ,and it was 142,i mean i vaguely remember the test,like SUPER vaguely,i just remember a bunch of really easy simple questions,and answering them all,and they were like "ok ur done",rifle, it's not,my mom's is higher than mine,and my grandfather's is higher than hers,my entire family's pretty smart,my mom is at 146,and my grandfather was like 155 or something,he was SUCH a genius,i could tell every time i spoke to him,that he was like super smart,he died before i rly knew him tho,<@192280862996430849> actually, the most common response is 7, but people know that, and then the second most common response for "thinking of a number that isn't 7" is 3.,Riddle me that, bitch,to be honest, i always knew 142 was above average IQ, but i considered myself "barely above average" because almost everyone i surround myself with has a higher IQ than me,my mom, grandfather, and both of my 2 lifelong friends,are all higher,i always feel dumb around them,but when im around random people,i almost don't consider them people,cus they're so stupid,it seems impossible,ya,IQ is your ability to learn,obviously, it's useless if you don't use it,i'm a prime example,im someone with limitless potential and absolutely no motivation or drive to succeed at anything academic,so i'm well below average,well,your ability to solve problems and know things is what makes you smart, no?,any other knowledge is just obtained through studying,anyone can do it,i mean your ability to solve problems you dont know the answer to,faster and better than others,IS intelligence,it's capacity to learn and to understand,better than others,anyone can learn anything with enough time and effort. Retarded people get through highschool with special ed teachers and 10 times as much effort/attention,Your intelligence is your ability to learn quickly and easily,less effort,for example, i was one of those guys where math always just clicked,the teacher would explain the math, write out the equation, and i'd just see it once and be able to do it 100%,there was nothing complex or confusing,i just did the thing that they did,and everyone else was confused,and im like,"what're you, retarded?",just do the thing he did,it just naturally made more sense to me,ya,i dropped out due to a lack of effort and interest,but i had straight A's my entire life in school,until i dropped to 0% in every class,i didn't even show up to any classes,for 3 years,cause i didn't want to,there's plenty of extremely intelligent people who drop out of highschool,most of them don't drop out just because they feel like it,but, i always do whatever i feel like,and nobody can stop me,so,of course,not that it's relevant to anything,cause their existence is so meaningless to begin with,eh?,im designed to be a god,i could tell since i was really young,i'm here to do great things,reproducing and settling down is what average beings do,i'm gonna be the guy who's remembered as an all time great,nah,i'll more likely be remembered overall as a gamer or as a legendary poker player later in life,im not sure how i want to be remembered yet,womack, that's a logical fallacy,you're making an assumption when im the one who lived through the experience,anime sucks,well, hajime no ippo is better,but it's 2nd,objectively speaking,in my world, there's not room for opinions,what i say is right,always.,happiness is fictional,as is sadness,everything is about how you percieve the world around you,you choose to be whatever you are,i feel like im actually too smart to feel genuine emotion,i understand emotions too well,to "feel them",ya,i've transcended,long ago,they're based on how you intake situations,you can control them,if it's manipulatable, it's fake,everything can be manipulated,including every single person,lol,if you force yourself to be happy, of course it is.,oooooo,if it isn't manipulated,hmmmmm,well, it's based on how you choose to intake the situation, like i said,if you genuinely are happy, then it's legitimate i suppose,but those are rare occurances,i'd say most emotions are fabricated based on perception,like the only emotion that i truly feel regularly is anger,and that's just because i allow myself to be easily angered,i could just not be angry if i felt like it,im so tired,i only slept for 11 hours,zzzzz,might go back to sleep,oh, people stopped talking,lameeeeeeeee,i was enjoying the conversation,quite a bit actually,this sort of philosophical talk is good,is that how less intelligent people see it?,interesting.,im a being capable of transcending humanity, but with so little motivation that nothing gets done,what a truly unique case,how can someone so gifted care so little,actually, i used to be like valien,but honestly, he's not even close to my level,i flamed way harder,lol,i just got bored of it,like i get bored of almost everything,fail,ure,why would sleeping more make me more tired,doesnt make sense,zzzz,honestly tho, it's kind of dope that that's the case,like,142,secondly,it's sick that i can sleep so much that i want to sleep more,cause sleep is like,probably my favorite thing,oh nothing verosk,it's pure boredom,he just wants attention,he doesn't want anything from anyone,and has no reason for doing it,he's justr bored,?,in GC i mean,should've clarified,not that it matters, since nobody below GC exists,so many randoms in gc,zzzz,well, i didn't really experience domestic abuse,i control everything around me to a pretty ridiculous degree,ooooo,well, i only lost any games at all cause of these winstreak kids,i was 98% winrate before that,the games i lose are out of my hands,RNG game,zzz,it was actually 98%,i had 1 loss,lol,then i went like,70% winrate,no,i was like 29-1,or something like that,same situation actually,all my losses are to ezmo,the champ isn't beatable in solo queue,u can't focus ezmo,but he kills u if u focus his teammate,it's so troll,well, not for shifu,he has no gapcloser and gets outtraded in melee range,no?,u have to save space for the weaken,then still get pushed back by the insta m2,you can counter it on a read,but it doesn't do anything,cus then, he e's, u wait, then u don't have space,and u die,wrong klerny,u can't react to shifu's incap which is 0.4,and my reaction speed is 180ms average,it's simply the game's netcode,laggy as fuck,if the game registered my Q press the instant i pressed it instead of 0.1 second delay + server lag + desync,then u might be able to react,but in reality there's like 0.3 at least,on every input,sux to be slow,i did it already,that's where i got the number from,i did it 10 times, not 5 btw,i sent the screenshot to averse a while ago,and jeff,,slow,cus i just woke up,zzz,ya actually,my reaction speed used to be 250-350 2 years ago,idk when i became so fast,but it was recent,maybe it was once i stopped doing drugs in highschool,🤔,they have long-lasting effects sometimes,ULU,i also use chrome tho,?,and i got 180,duh,everything i do shows that im god,it's obvious to anyone,https://youtu.be/q8VO4Rm3ulw?t=2m16s,<@!145953821615587328> exactly,look at that timestamp,that's me IRL,every minute of every day,it's based on monitor too eoekas,mine shot up over 100 ms,with my new monitor,yep,same,SeemsWutFaceMan,damn,im actually so sick,how can one man give so few fucks,that 180ms percentage <:pogCh:313335558967525377>,damn im fucking,SICKKKKKKKK,UGHHHHHHHHH,i got 218 and 220 on my last 2,when i was averaging 175,zzzzzzzz,FUCK,this is fuin,fun,i think i'll become pro at reacting,y-you too,nyy,nice genertics,👚,<@!145953821615587328> shit,is it 14 or 16,pretty sure it's 16,AHHHHHHHHHH,well,if u get below 180 ur cheating,the site doesn't have cheat protection,so,ya, i mean average,i had a couple around 170,u can't average that tho,cus that would mean due to variancwe,you'd need to get like,150 on some,which is straight impossible,Tyler Watson
Yesterday at 5:58am
I saw icefire playing and I heard that he thinks he's good and I felt disgusted, icefire, you're so fricking bad dude NEVER say or think you're good again. MM me for any amount, I'll play with an offbrand hori controller and if I don't double three stock you or better, you win the MM. I'm going to poop on you so hard that you hopefully quit, at the very least I'm going to make you realize how fricking terrible you are. Please do the melee community a favor and play smash4 or something.,my local scene,thank you based fighting game community,these people understand,EU Brain lag LUL,every good player does both,-_-,-_-,-_-,-_-,actually,that's how shifu plays the lucie MU,cus petrify bolt,u either counter,or u get petrified,u can also counter AND get petrified tho,that's always fun,my god,he's done it,i did that with panic flask,but people give me too much respect now,nobody uses panic flask at me,ONLY pet bolt,it's so lame,lol,i wish i could go back to a time when my opponents didn't realize how good i am,are u memeing or,cause like,im 100% serious,i can javelin panic flask with 100% consistency,top NA lucie players know this,from having it happen 1000 times,and they literally,dont use the move anymore,lol,ya,u turn iva's the most broken thing in the game,i mean, it's like u forgot,im the guy who deleted lucie from the game,she's only back because of iva,as long as arakune exists,lucie is not viable,well, of course that WAS true until people started only pet bolting,and now it's a 50/50 guessing game,like pre-rework oldur,u have to know when she'll do it,no, because ur in melee range,it's not like she shoots it at you,she uses it when ur inside her,and u can't differentiate between pet bolt and m1,so,it's fuk'd,it's exactly the same as old oldur,like identical situation,fuk,ya,i told u,this game isn't about winning anymore,it doesn't matter,cause game is dead,i havent played in so long,im sloppy,holy FUCK,lucie needs to be nerfed,into the ground,lol,630 damage in one round,fucking ROFL,630 damage 1v1,almost lose,SICK game,christ,he hit every counter that round, including 2 pet bolts,still almost wins,lucie's insane,i mean, i've said for weeks,that lucie is the hardest healer to kill for shifu,but i didn't realize it was THIS hard in a 1v1,she just doesn't take any damage,her m1 does 60 damage,wtf is this champ,ya,ik,but it's cancer,lol,holy fuck i almost lost again,this champ,send help dude,but also, i figured out the problem that's making it so hard,ur gonna think im johninh, but it's a real thing,the same thing i experienced against eygrr's pearl,because of the ping, the game doesn't accurately show the startup of animations on your moves, they just come out instantly with no animation,and it was happening with panic flask,it was impossible to react to,the pink flask would just fly out with virtually no animation, maybe the VERY end of it 0.2 seconds before or so,but definitely not even close to enough to react to,shifu honestly can't win that MU if he can't react to panic flask,i was just guessing,cus i couldn't react,well it'll be the same both ways,i assume he can't see my animations either,but shifu doesn't really have any animations it's important to react to,incap is unreactable, and everything else is just damage rotations,well,it's also definitely true that a lot of it is on me,i've forgotten how to play lucie,nobody's good at her here except neewha and he's become rusty,i couldn't figure out what to do for a while,i'd be willing to do more 1v1s for sure,nikita's just talented,he has a good understanding of every single champ,plays them "properly",like his lucie looked like any other good lucie,constantly baited with barely missed m1's, rotated skills properly,really good aim,i didn't see anything where i was like "wow nikita's lucie sucks",seemed good to me,lol,oh,LOL,ya i was getting a little tilted,u honestly were playing like prime stro,like,80% of my counters were barely not hit,by like 2 inches,and i was like "is nikita a god?","wtf is this",it was in the back of my mind u might just suck at aiming,but i assumed u did it on purpose,well,i spear iframed every single one i think,so that didn't help,lol,no way man,unreactable pearl silence is hell on earth,i want lucie practice since we'll play against it today,im only willing to practice enough that we don't lose,lol,and honestly, it if becomes too hard,im okay with losing,is that like super weird coming from me?,i feel like im the kind of guy who would always win at any cost,but honestly we've been winning for so long, and the game is so dead,i just like,don't care anymore,lol,if we lose, whatever,i'll find something else to do finally,been so bored of BR for so long,but i dont like losing,losing not fun,br not fun even when u win,i tried to join eoekas,but it said it timed out,i've been kidnapped by nikita lucie,<:feelsSomethingman:285783203913138187>,,turns out eu ping is LUL,i reaction countered his m1 and it went through me and did 21 damage while i was glowing blue,<:FeelsBadMan:269923546354941962>,,takes SO long to kill her,i barely fucked up that round,he just ran forever,ya,but if lucie could fight shifu,imagine how good she'd be vs every other melee,it's just how SLS has designed the game,rock paper scissors kits,shifu beats lucie by having by far the most gapclosers and iframes,and it's still kind of close,croak or raigon vs lucie is like,hang urself status,you'll NEVER kill her,croak can't,raigon is like lucie eater,it's just like how croak could never kill jumong 1v1,they run towards you instead of away, so space doesn't hit for the burst damage or healing,and then they just out sustain you slowly,nothing u can do,ya i agree with that,i think lucie beats croak,i always struggled a ton with lucie as croak,in 3v3 it's the opposite, lucie will always be much weaker 3v3 (unless she has iva on her team, but that's another conversation i dont want to get into),because lucie dies instantly to any hard cc,without iva,for example,do u think teldo could beat mini 1v1?,who would u place money on if u had to gamble,personally, i'd go mini for sure,ya 1v1,then mini vs PRIME WUZAC or something,u know the best croak,i think mini wins,easily,vs any of them,i think my croak would lose to neewha, for example,ME,PogChamp,MEEEEEE,wutface,nvm,honestly, realistically speaking,nikita's a better player than xaynox,so if xaynox wins,it really proves the point,i've seen a lot of his play and tourney results,or i should say,i've seen very little of xaynox in tournaments,which in and of itself implies he's bad,where is this idea,that i spam 1v1,i only 1v1'd my teammates because there was nobody else good enough for me to have to try so i could improve,that's why we're SO far above everyone else in NA,we improved against eachother,lol,1v1 is boring unless you're both extremely skilled,the next level mindgames and stuff you get into, especially in mirrors,are super fun,like shifu mirrors, or melee vs melee 1v1s,are actually really fun,ranged vs ranged is slow,anything vs healer is slow,but melee/melee is fun,technically averse,me and ninjas both deleted her,but she was dominating until we started sirius/shifuing lucie players,the "mongo meta" people THOUGHT existed,but didn't,it was just us,lol,<:feelsnikitaman:284752940290539531>,,xaynox isn't even spacing around nikita's space that well,keeps eating the 20 damage and barriering late,and still winning,nikita,u smell bad owo,i have wrote,LONG apology,to zab,:feelszabman:,cus for once im acknowledging when im in the wrong,and i like zab,first off flaming him over his performance in a video game,secondly for blowing it up way outside the game,thirdly for blaming him for simply defending himself,but ya,damn,nikita's croak is looking sick,,honestly one of the few 1v1 matchups in the game,that looks like it's pretty much 100% skill,it's all about clarity and deceit,and positoning correctly for punishes,ROFL,ya,i'd say the matchup is lucie favored,but it's like,55:45 for lucie,very very close,it's possible klerny will just destroy nikita,but that's skill difference,on champs,blast shield is really solid,https://twitter.com/hontosumanhossa/status/869371703838646272,<:pogCh:313335558967525377>,<:pogCh:313335558967525377>,<:pogCh:313335558967525377>,dude honestly,i need to EAT,i havent eaten all day,since i woke up,rofl,how good i am is directly proportional to how much i've played the last 7-14 days,when i try my hardest im very very good,but normally, i suck pretty bad,just cba to practice and keep un-rusty,like if im practicing im definitely top 5 in the world,but right now im prolly like,nyy level or something,not very good,his champ's braindead,he's inarguably less skilled,it's obvious by his mechanics,also, nikita WAS amazing,back in the day he was arguably the best player in EU,everyone knows he sucks now,himself included,he doesn't practice, what do you expect,^,no lol,nikita doesn't play at all,well,that was what i thought,nikita,wtf man,do u just suck,what matters is max potential,nikita is better than most people in EU when he tries his hardest, which also happens to be when he's playing much more than the average pro player,im in the same situation in NA,you can't go "well he's only better cause he plays more, when he plays the same amount he's worse",because that doesn't matter,what matters is who wins,well,my teamwork and gamesense are way above anyone else's,except ninjas,im 2nd,my mechanics are also top 5,im top 5 for sure in every respect,but my mechanics are probably the weakest,ironic, considering im by far the most technical shifu,,eoekas hacked my game,gg,nikita goes,"im a wall",and then stands there,<:feelsnikitaman:284752940290539531>,i gotta be honest, i'd normally shit talk u and say something like "i'll rape",but honestly i dont care,even if u win,it's whatever,lol,it's not my fault man,blame SLS,if the game had a promising future and i thought it'd get bigger,i'd be SO hype,i'd try my hardest and really compete,but the game's going to die,so why put in so much effort,lol,for now, im just milking the money we happen to be getting for free,im too lazy to practice anymore,so my skill is going to degrade,no, NA teams are,In fact,like 3-4 NA teams scrim daily,and they all solo queue daily,they're trying SO hard,and they're improving a ton too,averse doesn't play lol,he only plays LoL, osu, and PUBG,he hasn't played BR in forever,like basically, the other 3 big NA teams practice and scrim daily and are improving, Meanwhile, even ninjas has stopped playing BR. nobody on onslaught practices and we're all getting worse every day. It's only a matter of time now until we start losing.,But this time, i won't be motivated by our loss, i'll use the fact im no longer making money as an excuse to quit.,we don't really care anymore,i mean, maybe my teammates do,but they can just replace me,with someone motivated,shifu beats jade,just not in 3v3,<@125283574474735616> any ranged,well taya's weird,xaynox,did u want that 1v1 or not,i wanna go eat after,ok,i've never felt so unmotivated as i do now to play battlerite. It's always been motivating to continue winning money in the hope the esports take off,but since i personally feel the game WILL die, how do i stay motivated,the tournament is today. Like. In 30 minutes,and i haven't played at all,lol,it wasn't 180,it was 180-something,like 184 or smth,can't remember,he's done it,o ya,prl is today,i think,idk,ohhhhhhh,wow, it isn't,thank god,😄,i bought civ 5 yesterday,time to invest,4 0 0 , 0 0 0,hours,Right now in terms of development work happening, all I can say is, as has already been said, we're working on the new UI (a really big project that's incredibly time consuming thing to make, but the idea is this UI will have the space, the systems and adaptability for future features to blossom), a new campaign mode that replaces the tutorial (this will cover far more things about BR for people to learn how to play, and should be a lot more fun! It includes a map and hopefully some nice art too), we're also working on the F2P systems (this means things like how will the store work, currencies, economy, champion rotation, buying stuff etc etc), we're also reworking quests, we're testing casual game modes and I can hint that we're looking at improving the progression feeling as well (not to mention whatever else I have forgotten). With the time and resources we have, we felt these would be the top things that could help retention come F2P launch, where the influx of players will be our largest as we are saving our marketing budget for then.,wait,a GOD,DAMN,MINUTE,IS THIS,GOOD NEWS FROM SLS?,<:pogCh:313335558967525377>,NIKITA,HOLY FUCK,THEIR POST,IS,GOOD,GOOD POST BY SLS,many MANY things in the works currently apparently,and all of them are important,SLS brain <:PogChamp:282891715810033665>,i will be down syndrome,and have faith in sls one LAST time,well i'll post it,and someone should sticky it or smth,cus it's actually godlike,uh,the post is too long,to post,discord won't let me,well just read it urself,it's rly good,kateyparr new favorite person,<@179306091056726016> ur reddit post,is SO funny,im actually dying,eoekas can,it's his WORK OF ART,A D A Y I N T H E L I F E O F S L S S T U D I O S,@here kateyparr's response to this post https://www.reddit.com/r/BattleRite/comments/6e4572/a_casual_reminder/,actually so good,it's so good,never let averse drive,,"im not looking for something that doesn't exist","like a player stronger than myself",<:pogCh:313335558967525377>,,More like "that guy's great - great-great grandfather could have possibly, feasibly, potentially crossed paths w/ my slave great-great-great grandfather & gave him the stink-eye; how do I know?

Like really good","Like the best player i've ever played on netplay for sure",and i was like,"oh, thanks man :D",feels good man,there are now, but there weren't until the introduced of FM 4.4,which made it as good as crt consistently,now a ton of top players play netplay, basically all of them including like 3 or 4 of the gods,i regularly run into top 50 and even higher players on there,like top 10,fun to play against them,well, it depends on your region, the competition in EU especially outside of sweden is really weak for the most part.,Obviously there's some exceptions, but generally speaking it's a much weaker scene,even my local scene is like brutally stacked, i was struggling to even get top 3 most tournies and i was a really good player,im just CFL which is like 2nd or 3rd strongest region on earth,so u know how that goes,no,i don't bother learning or doing anything that isn't competitively viable in some way,it's the type of guy i am,there is no fun without winning,no,he isn't,in fact, he's the worst character in the game in ssbm,literal dead last,he's good in PM,but pm isn't a game so who cares,neither is smash 4,melee elitist god,my zed went from 35%

arakune is better than everyone else on earth combined and multipled by 30,000,we lost like 8 tournies ago when we were also at like 10%,we tried hard for a couple weeks, but it was a waste,we can win like this just fine,no,we're 100% unbeatable,there's a 5% chance of beating us IF we don't try at all,averse sux and loses rounds for free sometimes,not clip worthy,1v2 the entire round,beat my teammate's scores by 250 each,lol,womack ur too shit to even follow the game properly,u wont ever even be good enough to read the game,at all,lol,eh?,you misunderstand,the game isn't worth caring about, nor trying,we'll win no matter what,the chance of losing is 0%,no matter what.,understand your place, trash.,Below me.,You should get on your knees and lick my feet.,zzz,i told you, there's no point in trying...,it's futile.,nobody cares what should've happened,we aren't trying at all,we don't even care if we lose,at all,as a matter of fact,i've been ASKING for a team to beat us,so i'd be allowed to quit,for weeks,but nobody can do it,even without any of us playing,all 3 of us have clear weaknesses people could exploit to win now that we didn't have before,what part of,"we don't care",don't you get,well,i dont lose anyway, for some reason,it's almost like people are so terrified of us that winning is impossible just because it's us,has nothing to do with our play at all,it's both, fool.,im the human embodiment of aomine daiki,except everyone on my team is,you'd be lucky to get me to play at all, let alone try,so?,aomine infinity times stronger than akashi,doesn't

anti-gun arguments over the years,haven't ever really had a stance since i've never fired a gun,but if u look at EU and like the middle east as prime examples, the right choice to me seems to be tight gun regularity and a pretty good control over the weaponry,the middle east and US are comparable in that it's really easy to get a gun in both scenarios. Obviously one is also third world and the other isn't, and one is like, a non-warring non-insane society and the other isn't,but even in the US the results of easily accessible guns aren't good,but u could chalk that up to the amount of tension there is between the left and the right and people's stress over the declining economy causing more crimes,but honestly, it's all just a bunch of bullshit, we're all gonna die anyway,so think about that,dude my life is such a meme,im soooooooo tired of people giving a shit about what i say and do,apparently i told someone to kill themselves in league and streamed like 1 or 2 days of it,and it got sent to my sponsor,somehow,and now they're bitching at me,and im SURE it's already all over reddit,and of course this is the same day my interview with TJ about toxicity goes up,where i actually put myself in a much better light,zzzzzz,im just,sick of it,people shouldn't care what i say and do if they don't care what anyone else says and does.,This shit is stupid.,valien acts 300,000 times worse,or some other inquantifiable amount,and gets no shit,from anyone,nobody cares that he exists at all,lol,no,the exact problem is how much they care,i WISH nobody cared,then i could do what i want,like everyone else can,im tired of representing people,yeah, i agree,i've grown tired of this,i get nothing out of my sponsor anyway,the only person i need and have ever needed is myself,sponsors are whatever,teammates are whatever,everything is me,pubg not rly competitive,i care much more about ssbm,i'll dedicate my life to it,like,im willing to put 100% of my effort into ssbm,something i never did for BR,or pretty much any other game,in what way?,it's a game of pure speed and mechanical skill, and 1v1,lol,you don't know who i am,i was already making money in ssbm,and im far better now than i was then,im a monster in that game,it's more than what i make in BR,so who cares,?,ur so stupid...,do u really think i care?,at all?,ssbm gets bigger literally every tournament,the very last major which was literally 5 days ago,had 1800 entrants,bordering on the highest ever in any tournament,lol,1k a month is a miniscule amount,i need to make 10 times that at a minimum,you act like it'll grow,and not shrink,once the game is out,[–]Ikeifu 15 points 15 hours ago

admirer if large,these are the people im trying to impress?,please, just end me now,put me out of my misery,LOL,hmmmm,apparently the things i said made it to the BR community anyway,so im pretty much str8 fucked,zzzz,i don't remember,i was playing with jeff, and we have this sort of running joke for years now of coming up with the most creative and rude insults possible,partially for comedy, but also partially cus we actually hate bad/stupid teammates,and i was with him at the time,so idk what the reason is,when im with jeff we both go super saiyan level 2 and flame the fuck out of everyone,supposedly, onslaught is gonna suspend me for this,i guess the backlash they're recieving this time is too much,fuck,so many people have been saying stuff like "onslaught is a joke, there's no way they'll be taken seriously if they let arakune get away with acting the way he does",so in reality, they're probably just saving their own asses,i know that,i haven't been toxic in battlerite on nearly the scale i used to be for at least 3 months. It's been a large positive change,but I screw up once in LoL and suddenly it's everywhere,I mean seriously, I'm so good at pissing people off,it's insane,given, it's a skill i've refined for the last 13 years at least,but i insult a guy once and he dedicates his entire day to trying to ruin my life,because my insults hurt so bad,he probably still remembers them now,unfortunately, im in a contract with them and I don't remember all the details,they may actually have the power to force me not to compete,but i need the money,what a pain.,nah,there's nothing like that in there,im just saying,i dont remember the EXACT amount of control they have,probably enough to force me not to play though,and honestly speaking, it's probably best for me too,the backlash i'd recieve from doing something like this normally would be enormous. But if onslaught handles the punishment, I think most people will feel satisfied enough to go "good, fuck him, he got his" and not persue me any further,it may actually be the best option this time,pretty stupid tho,nah,i'd probably really have to not compete,but this is the first time my words have cost me the thing i actually care about,money,i'll probably actually learn my lesson this time,i never want to lose money,well,the issue is if they kick me off onslaught,ninjas and averse are still forced in a contract with them,i wouldn't be able to team with my teammates,^>^,no,they're in a contract,they can obviously enter any tournament, but they have to be "team onslaught",obviously if im benched/suspended from onslaught,they can't play with me,lol,well,i can't talk about what's in the contract,NDA,but im fairly sure they can't just break it for no reason. I don't remember what the damage was for doing it, but that means it wasn't bad enough to be worth remembering. It wasn't like we lose money or something insane like that,uh,i got a sickass chair,dude,LOL?,it's a 600 dollar chair,i can't remember that one big "gamer chair" brand,u guys know the one,ya that one,it's a competition company with them,Clutch chairZ,chairZ,chairZ,the chair's basically exactly the same, i dont know enough about chairs to tell you the difference,no it like, actually is,<@98465602670186496> they're partnered with the WWE,Averse ツ - Today at 8:22 AM
The last 2 tourneys have been bad though
Both ninjas and I expressed concern of you not wanting to play/you not caring we won or not,-_-...,-_-.............,well, naturally i bought the most expensive chair in my range,i think around 450 bucks,have to say,it's quite comfy,i GOT that one,they basically gave us a voucher that said "get any chair for free","just pick one",and so i did,ur ridiculous,PRL is 70 dollars per tourney win,battlerekt (back when it existed) was 66.66 dollars,yeah, but don't forget,that's because there's a 20,000 dollar 10 week series going on,you think that money is consistent?,rofl,we're making 4 times what we normally make right now,or so,what about the other 40 weeks of the year,rofl,hello?,i dont buy anything ever,save all money,indefinitely,alright,u guys are retarded,me and my sponsor both give eachother basically nothing,it simply exists for SOME reason,i wanna clarify,i didn't care about signing with them,averse and ninjas BOTH wanted to,so i said "ok",that's all,i am,but i don't get in unnecessary conflict,im too lazy,im pretty much "whatever" about everything,i dont care who does what as long as we win,no,that's conflict i deem necessary,idiots don't have the right to exist in my presence,so conflict is necessary,i wouldn't argue with that,im not sure what ur asking,oh, no,it was from league,but it was this week,probably a couple days ago,well, supposedly it isn't on reddit yet,i haven't seen it yet,but it will be im sure,im probably fucked,to be fair, i haven't seen these screenshots yet myself,but ik what i said,and it was pretty rude,even when i get autofilled to jg and camp bot they still get raped

he's just like me, but he's a year and a half older,A R A K U N E - Today at 8:47 AM
no job, no education, dropout
god at gaming,i used to admire jeff a lot,i thought he was the only person on earth more talented at gaming than me,but, eventually we both realized i was a lot better,especially jeff, he realized before i did,and i wouldn't accept it,cus i looked up to him,but i really am better,feels bad man,a,ya,teldo runs the entire planet,teldo is literally,alpha and omega,first and last,god,idek what rank i am on ladder anymore,prolly not top 10,maylon,remember to protect ur ass,ur in my prayers,oh, not only is jeff just like me,but we were also both diamond tryndamere mains,LOL,https://68.media.tumblr.com/4766f29a02a0ff6692ce5631c580d7e3/tumblr_oqzd7in9jD1vreeroo9_500.gif,<:pogCh:313335558967525377>,is it?,winning is the only purpose of gaming,just like it's the only purpose of sports,there can be no fun without winning.,the purpose of life is simply to enjoy yourself,but who enjoys themselves while losing?,well nyy,even with us winning we can certainly improve,that's obvious, because we don't try to win.,we just do,lol,it's become a running joke amongst onslaught,it's like we try less and less every week,but the results are the same,my personality doesn't mesh well with any type of person except people passionate about winning,ironically, it's the best kind of personality for a competitor,because it'll find you the best teammates,eh?,there's been team conflict since the beginning,the reason my teammates stick with me is because I don't lose.,there's nothing more complex than that,i don't even care if they like me,as long as we win, nothing matters,you underestimate me,as long as i decide to, i will never lose.,my mentality and team chemistry will fall apart when i lose, sure,but it will never happen.,Never.,there's no tension,i've never felt any stress or doubt,im confident in my teammates,but more than that, im confident in myself,even if both of them play like trash, we'll win,because i decide to win,so?,why would i give a shit what they think or feel,i'm me,who cares if he does?,you really underestimate me,nobody has seen what im capable of when i try,i don't care about anything that happens,i will always win,agree,besides, he voiced his concerns after the fact,i was working under the assumption both averse and ninjas didn't care about practicing or winning, but i didn't either,but they went behind my back to my sponsor to complain instead of saying something to me,you can say "clearly there's tension in the team, look at averse's complaints",but his complaints were,30 minutes ago,after weeks of him saying nothing,i can't be held responsible for not LITERALLY reading his mind,no u didn't,if u did, it somehow didn't stick,cus i dont recall that at all,look here's the bottom line,who cares?,as long as i play, we'll win,i'm aomine,my attitude,has nothing to do with anything,so what if i don't want to try?,so what if my morale bothers you?,we win anyway,as long as i show up, we win,it's just a good comparison,im a guy who can't possibly lose,so why are people so concerned,well mini, that's true,unless they play against me,again,im the worst player on my team sometimes because i choose to be. I'm putting forth no effort,but even 2 tournaments ago, averse and ninjas BOTH played like shit and i carried insanely hard,virtually 1v3'd half the rounds,even jeff who was spectating,said i played insane and they both played like shit,it was obvious to me,was i concerned or worried at all? of course not,because i'm there,there's no losing,i can be replaced, but it won't be the same.,There's nobody like me except me,i'm god,so?,i'm all the communication on our team,best rotations in the game period,best mechanics,there's nothing that anyone can beat me at,i'm me,there's nothing to see through,some day, the trash talk will annoy me,enough that i try,and you'll see on that day,what a nightmare i am,lol,well, who am i kidding, im lying,trash talk will never be enough motivation for me to try at something i don't want to try at,i need actual motivation, like strong opponents,something i'll never find.,indeed,joltz and klerny aren't even of comparable skill to me,much worse.,The 2nd and 3rd best players are my teammates,they're so good, that some weeks they play better than me,which is nice,lets me try less,for real, i haven't practiced a single game in weeks and do ninjas or averse ever hit me up and go "dude you really need to practice, you looked super bad in the last tournament" of course they don't.,But I say that exact same thing against them,why? because i'm better,i don't need to practice,they do,they're both unconfident, my attitude is another thing that helps the team, they've both told me so before.,i'll ask you once and once only,how fucking stupid can you be?,I have THE BEST teamplay in the game.,My rotations, shotcalling, etc are THE BEST,it's why we win,i'm not as simple as to ONLY be the best mechanical player in the game,im the best in EVERY,SINGLE,POSSIBLE,RESPECT,there isn't a single player ON EARTH who can beat me in ANY area of the game,that's what you're missing xaynox,im not JUST the most skilled player,that's a piece of the puzzle,im the complete package,with ZERO weaknesses,that's why i'll never lose,ninjas can't beat me,the last time ninjas and i played, i beat him 5-0, 5-1, 5-1.,It was a total blowout.,And at that time, i wasn't practicing either,it's just me,<@83555170096517120> my solo queue winrate against him is also absurdly high,same with averse,l0l,l0l,l0l,ULU,averse is weird man,he just told me,he doesn't think we'll be the best forever,?????,maybe that's the difference that makes them worse,who knows,or, maybe the mentality is different BECAUSE they're worse,either way, my mentality is this way from years of proving myself,im confident,Arakune - Today at 9:35 AM
im saying, even if the playerbase increases by 100 times
we'll remain at the top
you were a challenger league player. You know well that you can stand amongst the best no matter how many opponents there are or how skilled they are
it's just a matter of being better
we're truly the best
i've been rank 1 global in a handful of games, and im in the top 0.1% of every game i play despite not committing myself fully, so i know it too
the only one i sort of doubt is ninjas, but i mean, have you seen ninjas?
The only reason he doesn't have such a nice resume like us is because he's 15 and just started his pro gaming career. He's still improving and will continue improving for years, he might even surpass us eventually (in fact, there's been moments in BR where he has already)
We're a superstar team with unreal skill
lol
all 3 of us are like, well within the top 0.01% of gamers
honestly objectively speaking
to combine that into a team with a meta-correct team composition, good communication, and good teamwork?
what on EARTH could possibly stop us
